/**
 A router delegate interacts with one or more `Router` instances, such as `RouteController` objects, during turn-by-turn navigation. This protocol is similar to `NavigationServiceDelegate`, which is the main way that your application can synchronize its state with the SDK’s location-related functionality. Normally, you should not need to make a class conform to the `RouterDelegate` protocol or call any of its methods directly, but you would need to call this protocol’s methods if you implement a custom `Router` class.
 
 `MapboxNavigationService` is the only concrete implementation of a router delegate. Implement the `NavigationServiceDelegate` protocol instead to be notified when various significant events occur along the route tracked by a `NavigationService`.
