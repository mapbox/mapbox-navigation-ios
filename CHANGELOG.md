* Deprecated `NavigationSettings.initialize(directions:tileStoreConfiguration:routingProviderSource:alternativeRouteDetectionStrategy:utilizeSensorData:navigatorPredictionInterval:liveIncidentsOptions:statusUpdatingSettings:)` method in favor of `NavigationSettings.initialize(with:)`. ([#4275](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/4275))
* Added new parameter that allows configuring logging level for Mapbox SDKs. Checkout new `NavigationSettings.initialize(with:)` method for more information. ([#4275](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/4275))
* Fixed an issue where the `UserHaloCourseView` will be shown under reduced location accuracy mode with `NavigationMapview.reducedAccuracyActivatedMode` as `false`. Right now `UserHaloCourseView` will be applied in only one case: when user explicitly sets `NavigationMapView.reducedAccuracyActivatedMode` to `true`, and the `Precise Location` property in the settings of current application is disabled by user. ([#4285](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/4285))
* Fixed an issue where `ExitView` used dark style when using InstructionCardViewController instead of light style for both highlighted and default states of the instruction card. ([#4160](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/4160))
* Added `ExitView.highlightColor` and `GenericShield.highlightColor` properties that allow users to customize the highlight color of `ExitView` and `GenericShield`s to better fit their application `Style`. ([#4160](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/4160))
* `SimulatedLocationManager`'s  initializer `SimulatedLocationManager.init(route:currentDistance:currentSpeed:)` is now public. ([#4276](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/4276))
* Added a console message when a newer version of Navigation SDK is available. ([#4280](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/4280))
* Fixed an issue where `Bundle.string(forMapboxNavigationInfoDictionaryKey:)` and `Bundle.string(forMapboxCoreNavigationInfoDictionaryKey` returned values from the application bundle instead of the Navigation SDK when statically linking using Cocoapods. ([#4280](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/4280))
* Added `IndexedRouteReponse.parseAlternativeRoutes` method to extract `AlternativeRoute`s data from a response. ([#4294](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/4294))

## v2.9.0

### Packaging

* MapboxNavigation now requires [MapboxMaps v10.9._x_](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/releases/tag/v10.9.1). ([#4239](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/4239))

### Map

* Traffic lights, stop signs, yield signs, and railroad crossings now appear along the route during turn-by-turn navigation. To disable these icons, set the `NavigationViewController.annotatesIntersectionsAlongRoute` and `CarPlayNavigationViewController.annotatesIntersectionsAlongRoute` properties to `false`. ([#4185](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/4185))
* `NavigationMapView.removeAlternativeRoutes()` and `NavigationMapView.removeContinuousAlternativeRoutesDurations()` were made public to provide a way to remove previously shown alternative routes and alternative routes duration annotations, respectively. ([#4134](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/4134))
* Fixed an issue where tapping on a route duration annotation that overlaps a different route would cause the wrong route to be passed into `NavigationMapViewDelegate.navigationMapView(_:didSelect:)` or `NavigationMapViewDelegate.navigationMapView(_:didSelect:)`. ([#4133](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/4133))
* Fixed an issue where the shields in the instruction are using the style from last navigation session with the `NavigationMapView` injection used in the new session. ([#4197](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/4197))
* Fixed an issue where the `NavigationMapView.localizeLabels()` method only localized map labels according to the user’s Preferred Language Order setting if the application also had a localization in the preferred language. ([#4205](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/4205))
* Additional parameters were added to `FloatingButton.rounded(image:selectedImage:size:type:imageEdgeInsets:cornerRadius)` to be able to provide button type, button image edge insets and corner radius. ([#4060](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/4060), [#4157](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/4157))
* `FloatingButton` no longer contains corner radius shadow, border is applied instead. ([#4060](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/4060))
* Added the `NavigationViewControllerDelegate.navigationViewController(_:didSelect:)` and `NavigationViewControllerDelegate.navigationViewController(_:didSelect:)` methods that allow selection of the waypoint and continuous alternative. ([#4175](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/4175))
* `NavigationMapView.showcase(_:routesPresentationStyle:legIndex:animated:duration:completion:)` now contains a `legIndex` parameter that allows highlighting one leg more prominently than other legs of the route. ([#4211](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/4211))
* Fixed an issue where the route line with no traffic congestion data and multiple legs wasn't shown correctly. ([#4217](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/4217))
* Fixed a crash when setting the `NavigationMapView.userLocationStyle` property to `UserLocationStyle.puck3D`. ([#4239](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/4239))

### Preview

* Added the `PreviewViewController` that along with the ability to display a route preview map allows to present banners with additional information. Such banners should conform to `Banner` protocol. The Mapbox Navigation SDK also provides default banners that allow to present address of the final destination (`DestinationPreviewViewController`) and route information like estimated time of arrival, total duration and distance (`RoutePreviewViewController`). The `PreviewViewControllerDelegate` protocol allows to observe `Banner` presentation and dismissal events. Seamless transition between `PreviewViewController` and `NavigationViewController` can be reached by using `UIViewControllerTransitioningDelegate` and replacing existing `NavigationViewController.navigationMapView` instance with the one that is used in `PreviewViewController`. ([#4227](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/4227), [#4188](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/4188))

### Banners and guidance instructions

* Added replacement for `VisualInstruction.maneuverImageSet(side:)` method to generate a maneuver image on iOS 13 and above. ([#4161](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/4161))
* Road shield images are now cached and re-used across multiple application sessions. ([#3930](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3930))
* Fixed an issue where the CarPlay style change would affect the style of Mapbox designed shields on mobile. ([#3930](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3930))
* Fixed an issue where the Mapbox designed shields and generic shields have different sizes in instruction banner. ([#3930](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3930))
* Turn lane indications now appear even if they slightly differ from what the routing engine would have inferred from the road geometry, For example, turn lanes now appear where the user is expected to use a lane marked as as a right turn lane to make a slight right turn. ([#4191](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/4191))
* Route shields now respect language-specific route numbers in Japan. ([#4191](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/4191))
* Improved the timing of some spoken instructions. ([#4191](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/4191))
* Fixed an issue where the current road name label appeared even while the user is not traveling on a known road. ([#4191](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/4191))
* Fixed an issue where top and bottom banners were not presented when starting active navigation session. ([#4222](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/4222))

### Location tracking

* Fixed an issue where the user’s location history was sometimes matched to unnavigable paths, leading to unreliable location snapping. ([#4191](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/4191))
* Fixed an issue where the `RoadObjectMatcher.matchOpenLR(location:identifier:)` method would incorrectly match some TPEG OpenLR identifiers. ([#4191](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/4191))
* Added `HistoryReader` for parsing history files. ([#4194](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/4194))

### Routing

* `IndexedRouteResponse` is now the preferred way for setting up routing information for navigation. `NavigationViewController`, `MapboxNavigationService`, `Router` and `RoutingProvider` are updated to accomodate this change. ([#4127](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/4127))
* Added the `RouteController.prefersOnlineRoute` property, which lets you automatically switch from a route generated on the device to one generated by the Mapbox Directions API if the geometries match. Use `NavigationViewControllerDelegate.navigationViewController(_:didSwitchToCoincidentOnlineRoute:)`, `NavigationServiceDelegate.navigationService(_:didSwitchToCoincidentOnlineRoute:)`, `RouterDelegate.router(_:didSwitchToCoincidentOnlineRoute:)` or `.routeControllerDidSwitchToCoincidentOnlineRoute` notification to track such events. ([#4127](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/4127))

* Fixed an issue where continuous alternative route lines and their corresponding callouts were misplaced on long routes. ([#4176](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/4176))
* Added `ReplayLocationManager(history:)` and `MapboxNavigationService(history:customRoutingProvider:credentials:eventsManagerType:routerType:customActivityType:)` for replaying trips recorded by a history file. ([#4194](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/4194))
* Fixed an issue where after route refresh, the `RouteStepProgress.userDistanceToUpcomingIntersection`, `RouteStepProgress.intersectionsIncludingUpcomingManeuverIntersection`, `RouteStepProgress.intersectionDistances` and `RouteStepProgress.intersectionIndex` are all set to default values. ([#4193](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/4193))
* Route refreshing now respects current user progress on a leg to reduce update size and improve updating longer routes. ([#4111](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/4111))
* Added `RoutingProvider.refreshRoute(indexedRouteResponse:fromLegAtIndex:routeShapeIndex:legShapeIndex:completionHandler:)` to request a refresh starting from specified shape index. Updated `RouteLegProgress` and `RouteProgress` initializers to include shape indices, and added `RouteProgress.refreshRoute(with:at:legIndex:legShapeIndex:)` to apply partial route refresh. ([#4111](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/4111))
* Fixed an issue where some alternative routes did not begin at the user’s current location or did not end at the same location as the main route. ([#4191](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/4191))
* Fixed an issue where some continuous alternative routes were unavailable or not consistently available when the user is traveling at low speed. ([#4191](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/4191))
* Fixed an issue where the values of `RouteLeg.segmentDistances` and `RouteLeg.expectedTravelTime` did not add up to `RouteLeg.distance` and `RouteLeg.expectedTravelTime`, respectively. Each value of `RouteLeg.expectedTravelTime` that immediately follows an intersection now includes the time required to traverse the intersection. ([#4191](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/4191))
* Fixed an issue where some [rat runs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat_running) were suggested as alternative routes that matched the main route. These alternative routes are no longer suggested at all. ([#4191](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/4191))
* Fixed an issue where routes avoided roads with the deprecated tags [`hov=lane`](https://taginfo.openstreetmap.org/tags/hov=lane) and `hov:conditional=lane @ …` as restricted roads. ([#4191](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/4191))
* Fixed an issue where the user’s location would get out of sync after traveling through short tunnels. ([#4239](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/4239))
* Fixed a crash after changing `RouteController.prefersOnlineRoute` from `false` to `true`. ([#4239](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/4239))

### User feedback

* The MapboxMobileEvents dependency is no longer used. Feedback events are now handled by MapboxCommon. ([#4011](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/4011))
* Deprecated `NavigationEventsManager.init(activeNavigationDataSource:passiveNavigationDataSource:accessToken:mobileEventsManager:)` in favor of `NavigationEventsManager.init(activeNavigationDataSource:passiveNavigationDataSource:accessToken:)`. ([#4011](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/4011))

### Predictive caching

* Implemented predictive cache with `TilesetDescriptor` so that volatile sources are not loaded unexpectedly. ([#4213](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/4213))
* Deprecated `PredictiveCacheManager.init(predictiveCacheOptions:styleSourcePaths:)` and `PredictiveCacheManager.init(predictiveCacheOptions:mapOptions:)` in favor of `PredictiveCacheManager.init(predictiveCacheOptions:cacheMapOptions:)`. ([#4213](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/4213))
* Added `PredictiveCacheMapsOptions` (map specific, that also allow to specify zoom levels for which the map tiles should be cached) and `PredictiveCacheNavigationOptions` (navigation specific) available through the `PredictiveCacheOptions`. ([#4213](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/4213))
* Deprecated `PredictiveCacheOptions.currentLocationRadius`, `PredictiveCacheOptions.routeBufferRadius`, `PredictiveCacheOptions.destinationLocationRadius`, `PredictiveCacheOptions.maximumConcurrentRequests`. Use `PredictiveCacheOptions.predictiveCacheNavigationOptions` and `PredictiveCacheOptions.predictiveCacheMapsOptions` instead for separate predictive cache configuration for maps and navigation. ([#4213](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/4213))
* Added `PredictiveCacheManager.updateMapControllers(cacheMapOptions:)` for cashing map styles after they are loaded. ([#4213](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/4213))

### Other changes

* Added `NavigationViewController.usesNightStyleInDarkMode` property to control whether night style is used in dark mode. ([#4143](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/4143))
* Fixed an issue where the rerouting audio cue stopped background audio. ([#3642](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3642))
* Fixed an issue where the rerouting audio cue played even if `RouteVoiceController.playRerouteSound` was set to `false`. ([#4214](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/4214))
* Added `BorderCrossing.init(from:to:)` to allow creation of `BorderCrossing` publicly. ([#4226](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/issues/4226))

## v2.8.1

* Fixed an issue where creating a `RouteController` with the result of `RouteResponse(matching:options:credentials:)` would cause route progress and guidance instructions to remain stuck at the beginning of the route. ([#4186](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/4186))

* Fixed an issue where the destination building failed to highlight if the user has gotten rerouted at any time during the trip. ([#4085](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/4085))
* Fixed an issue where the map would cut off a continuous alternative route to appear as if it began after the deviation point. ([#4085](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/4085))
* Fixed an issue where the callout annotating a continuous alternative route appeared far away from the route and contained an inaccurate travel time. ([#4085](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/4085))
* Fixed an issue where some roads were shown as restricted on the route line even if public access is allowed for “local traffic only”. ([#4085](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/4085))
* Fixed an issue where the `NavigationMapView.traversedRouteColor` property had no effect on the traversed part of the route line. ([#4106](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/4106))

### Guidance instructions

* Fixed an issue where the top banner and current road name label represented Mexican state highways with generic shields. ([#4085](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/4085))
* Fixed an issue where the route would instruct the user to make a “U-turn” toward the passenger side wherever the user should actually make two successive turns toward the passenger side or take an exit ramp that curves 180°. ([#4085](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/4085))
* `JunctionView` now appears after passing some toll booths or electronic toll collection points in Japan. ([#4085](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/4085))
* Improved the pronunciation of junction names in Japanese in Japan. ([#4085](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/4085))
* At a fork or exit on an expressway in Japan, spoken instructions now mention the junction name and side of the road but no longer mention the expressway name or number that the user would stay on. ([#4085](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/4085))
* Fixed confusing instructions to take the roundabout in the Russian localization. ([#4085](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/4085))
* Fixed the crashes occured in guidance instructions during offline navigation. ([#4147](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/4147))

### Routing

* Fixed an issue where a route would U-turn outside the destination parking lot, avoiding a more direct parking lot entrance. ([#4085](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/4085))
* If `RouteOptions.departAt` or `RouteOptions.arriveBy` is set, the resulting route now respects turn restrictions that depend on the date or time. ([#4085](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/4085))
* Eliminated the time penalty that was applied to barriers such as gates and border crossings, which was redundant to the effective time penalty from predicted speeds around the barrier. ([#4085](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/4085))
* A multi-leg route that crosses an international border can now have alternative routes. ([#4085](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/4085))
* Curvy roads are penalized slightly more consistently. ([#4085](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/4085))
* You can now set `Waypoint.allowsSnappingToStaticallyClosedRoad` to `true` to allow the waypoint to snap to a road that is fully closed for long-term construction. ([#4085](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/4085))

([#4102](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/4102))
* Fixed incorrect duration calculations and route refreshing when an arrival step’s geometry contained only one coordinate. Normally, an arrival step’s geometry is expected to be a zero-length `LineString`; that is, with two coincident coordinates. ([#4110](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/4110))
* Routes now respect conditional access restrictions that depend on the year. ([#4144](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/4144))

* Fixed an issue where the `RoadObjectMatcher.matchOpenLR(location:identifier:)` method sometimes returned the wrong parallel roadway. ([#4110](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/4110))
* Removed the `Hashable`-conforming extension for `CLLocationCoordinate2D` in `MapboxCoreNavigation` to fix a compiler error in applications that define their own `Hashable` conformance for this type. ([#4109](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/4109))
* Fixed the crash that sometimes occurs when orientation of the view controller that contains `NavigationView` is being changed and `NavigationView`'s parent view is being deallocated at the same time. ([#4118](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/4118))

## 2.7.3

### Packaging

* MapboxCoreNavigation now requires [MapboxNavigationNative v111._x_](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-native-ios/releases/tag/111.0.2). ([#4255](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/4255))

### Routing

* Added `Router.finishRouting()` method to finish routing session without dismissing related UI and logic components. ([#3880](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3880))
* Added reporting `AlternativeRoute` during navigation sessions. Subscribe to `RouterDelegate.router(_:didUpdateAlternatives:removedAlternatives:)` or `Notification.Name.routeControllerDidUpdateAlternatives` notification to receive updates on actual alternative routes list. Switching to the alternative route could be monitored by observing `RouterDelegate.router(_:willTakeAlternativeRoute:at:)` and `RouterDelegate.router(_:didTakeAlternativeRouteAt:)` methods or `Notification.Name.routeControllerWillTakeAlternativeRoute` and `Notification.Name.routeControllerDidTakeAlternativeRoute` notifications. To configure alternative routes detection, setup `NavigationSettings.AlternativeRouteDetectionStrategy` before starting navigation. ([#3833](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3833))
* During turn-by-turn navigation, the map view displays any alternative routes that are currently available. Tapping an alternative route switches to it, just like in a standalone `NavigationMapView`. ([#3850](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3850))
* Implemented refreshing `RouteLeg.incidents` during a route refreshing. ([#3931](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3931))

* Snapped locations are spaced more evenly when the application is connected to an external GPS or CarPlay device capable of high-frequency location updates and the user rounds a corner. ([#3913](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3913))
* Fixed an issue where the user’s location would be snapped to the nearest road while the user moved around in a parking garage where the [parking aisles](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:service%3Dparking_aisle) have not been mapped in detail. ([#3913](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3913))
* Fixed an issue where `RouteController` sometimes took too long to detect that the user went off the route after making a turn or taking an off-ramp. ([#3913](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3913))
* When proactive reroute happens, new departure voice instruction will not be pronounced anymore. ([#3937](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3937))
* Fixed an issue where a departure instruction (e.g., “Head west”) was announced periodically in the middle of a trip due to proactive rerouting. ([#3937](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3937))

### Camera

* Fixed an issue where camera stops updating when `centerUpdatesAllowed`, `zoomUpdatesAllowed`, `bearingUpdatesAllowed`, `pitchUpdatesAllowed` or `paddingUpdatesAllowed` disabled in `OverviewCameraOptions` and `FollowingCameraOptions`. ([#3946](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3946))

### Pricing

* When calling `MapboxNavigationService.start()` and `MapboxNavigationService.stop()` billing session will be resumed and paused respectively. ([#3928](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3928))

### Map

* Added `NavigationMapView.tolerance` property to configure the tolerance of map sources for route line, maneuver arrow, and restricted areas. The property controls the level of simplification by specifying the maximum allowed distance between the original line point and the simplified point. A higher tolerance value results in higher simplification. ([#3891](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3891))
* Added the `layerPosition` parameter to the `NavigationMapView.show(_:layerPosition:legIndex:)` method for controlling the position of the main route layer while presenting routes. ([#3897](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3897))
* Fixed an issue where camera kept receiving updates even after stopping `MapboxNavigationService`. ([#3928](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3928))
* Added `NavigationViewController.showsContinuousAlternatives` and `CarPlayNavigationViewController.showsContinuousAlternatives` flags to toggle displaying alternative route's lines during navigation session. Use `NavigationMapView.show(continuousAlternatives:)` and `NavigationMapView.removeContinuousAlternativesRoutes()` methods for fine control over displayed routes. ([#3850](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3850))

### CarPlay

* Fixed an issue where route shields disappeared when the user enters a tunnel. ([#3882](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3882))
* The map automatically chooses the night style when "Always Show Dark Maps" is enabled in the Appearance section of Settings. ([#3882](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3882))
* Renamed the `VisualInstruction.carPlayManeuverLabelAttributedText(bounds:shieldHeight:window:)` to the `VisualInstruction.carPlayManeuverLabelAttributedText(bounds:shieldHeight:window:traitCollection:instructionLabelType:)` to have the ability to change color of the shield icons depending on provided trait collection. ([#3882](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3882))
* Fixed an issue where a `StyleManager` for CarPlay would update the appearance on both CarPlay and the iOS device simultaneously. ([#3914](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3914))
* Fixed an issue where an appearance change of CarPlay would cause an appearance change of iOS as well. Refer to `DayStyle` while implementing custom styles using `Style` class. ([#3922](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3922))
* Fixed an issue where maneuver arrow wasn't removed after passing visual instruction on CarPlay. ([#3987](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3987))
* Fixed an issue where `LaneView` uses incorrect styling on CarPlay. ([#3975](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3975))

### Other changes

* Reduced peak memory usage.
* Fixed an issue when alternative route lines overlapped the main route line during navigation. ([#3947](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3947))
* Fixed an issue when rerouting to the route which does not originate on current user location, route line and camera jumped to route origin. ([#3943](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3943))
* All logs that Navigation SDK produces are now sent to the `MapboxCommon` framework. You can intercept these logs in your own code using `LogConfiguration.registerLogWriterBackend(forLogWriter:)` method from `MapboxCommon` framework. ([#3944](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3944))
* Fixed an issue where popped window doesn't get updated in appearance when style changes on phone. ([#3954](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3954))
* Fixed an issue where detailed feedback items don't change color in different style. ([#3954](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3954))

* MapboxCoreNavigation now requires [MapboxDirections v2.5._x_](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-directions-swift/releases/tag/v2.5.0). ([#3920](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3920))
* MapboxCoreNavigation now requires [MapboxNavigationNative v101._x_](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-native-ios/releases/tag/101.0.0). ([#3908](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3908))

### User interface

* Added the `CarPlayManagerDelegate.carPlayManager(_:shouldUpdateNotificationFor:with:in:)` and `CarPlayManagerDelegate.carPlayManager(_:shouldShowNotificationFor:in:)` methods for controlling the display of user notifications while the application is in the background in CarPlay. ([#3828](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3828))
* Fixed an issue where shields disappeared after the application returns to the foreground. ([#3840](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3840))
* The top banner now shows shields that are more consistent with the map and current road name label. ([#3864](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3864))
* Fixed an issue where exit views and generic shields in the top banner got outdated when the style changed during turn-by-turn navigation. ([#3864](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3864))
* Fixed an issue where the current road name label used a generic white circle instead of the correct shield to represent a state route in the United States. ([#3870](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3870))
* Lane guidance remains visible while the step table is visible. ([#3805](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3805))
* Removed a transparent gap that appeared between the top banner and step table if the user completed a maneuver while the step table was visible. ([#3805](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3805))
* Fixed an issue where a gray dashed line, which normally indicates a restricted-access road, appeared at the beginning of the route line even if there was no restriction. ([#3811](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3811))
* Lane guidance views will now be shown even when all lanes a valid for the current route. ([#3903](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3903))
* Fixed the crash of nonstop road shield updates when no valid road information contained in guidance instruction. ([#3911](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3911))

### User feedback

* Added the `NavigationViewControllerDelegate.navigationViewController(_:didSubmitArrivalFeedback:)` method, which is called when the user submits a rating or comment at the end of a trip. ([#3842](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3842))
* Fixed an issue where `EndOfRouteCommentView` is using dark style when only light style is allowed. ([#3845](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3845))

### Location tracking

* Added the `Router.initialManeuverAvoidanceRadius` property for adjusting the likelihood that the user will be rerouted onto a cross street very close to the current location. ([#3754](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3754))
* `UserPuckCourseView` no longer desaturates its color based on the age of the last location update. `RouteController` simulates location updates whenever Location Services is unable to receive real location updates. To ensure a steady stream of location updates outside of turn-by-turn navigation, install a `PassiveLocationManager`. ([#3836](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3836))
* Fixed an issue where `UserPuckCourseView`’s color desaturated during turn-by-turn navigation even as the location was being updated. ([#3836](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3836))
* Fixed an issue where the `PassiveLocationManager(directions:systemLocationManager:eventsManagerType:userInfo:datasetProfileIdentifier:)` initializer’s `datasetProfileIdentifier` argument was ignored. ([#3867](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3867))

* Fixed the possible crash after rerouting when `routeLineTracksTraversal` enabled. ([#3896](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3896))

### Routing

* Renamed `routingProvider` to `customRoutingProvider` within the `NavigationService` class and `Router` protocol. You can continue to implement a `RoutingProvider` to customize how the router calculates a new route when rerouting, but the default value is now `nil` when using the built-in rerouting behavior. ([#3754](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3754))
   * Renamed the `NavigationService(routeResponse:routeIndex:routeOptions:routingProvider:credentials:locationSource:eventsManagerType:simulating:routerType:)` initializer to `NavigationService(routeResponse:routeIndex:routeOptions:customRoutingProvider:credentials:locationSource:eventsManagerType:simulating:routerType:)`.
   * Renamed the `NavigationService(routeResponse:routeIndex:routeOptions:routingProvider:credentials:locationSource:eventsManagerType:simulating:routerType:)` initializer to `NavigationService(routeResponse:routeIndex:routeOptions:customRoutingProvider:credentials:locationSource:eventsManagerType:simulating:routerType:)`.
   * Replaced the `NavigationService.routingProvider` property with `NavigationService.customRoutingProvider`.
   * Renamed the `Router(alongRouteAtIndex:in:options:routingProvider:dataSource:)` initializer to `Router(alongRouteAtIndex:in:options:customRoutingProvider:dataSource:)`
   * Replaced the `Router.routingProvider` property with `Router.customRoutingProvider`.
* Renamed the `NavigationSettings.initialize(directions:tileStoreConfiguration:)` method to  `NavigationSettings.initialize(directions:tileStoreConfiguration:routingProviderSource:)`. This method allows you to control whether the rerouting uses the network or offline routing data. ([#3754](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3754), [#3824](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3824))
* Fixed an issue where a failure to calculate a route offline could result in a successful result being passed to a `Directions.RouteCompletionHandler`.
* Added the public property of `NavigationMapView.routeLineTracksTraversal` when standalone `NavigationMapView` is used for active navigation. When it's set to `true`, call `NavigationMapView.updateRouteLine(routeProgress:coordinate:shouldRedraw:)` to update the route line, part of the route line disappears behind the user puck as the user travels along the main route. ([#3855](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3855))

### CarPlay

* Fixed an issue where an active navigation using CarPlay application with route that contains multiple legs would cause a memory leak. ([#3877](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3877))
* Added the `CarPlayManagerDelegate.carPlayManager(_:shouldUpdateNotificationFor:with:in:)` and `CarPlayManagerDelegate.carPlayManager(_:shouldShowNotificationFor:in:)` to provide the ability to control notifications presentation while CarPlay application is in the background. ([#3828](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3828))

### Other changes

* During turn-by-turn navigation, incidents along the route are now refreshed periodically along with traffic congestion.
* When the user passes a named toll collection point, the `TollCollection` object obtained through the `Notification.Name.electronicHorizonDidPassRoadObject` notification now has the `TollCollection.name` property set.

## v2.4.3

### Packaging

* Fixed an issue where dependencies couldn't be resolved when using Swift Package Manager. ([#4332](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/4332))
* MapboxNavigation now requires [MapboxMaps v10.5.1](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/releases/tag/v10.5.1). ([#4332](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/4332))
* MapboxCoreNavigation now requires [MapboxDirections v2.6._x_ or v2.7._x_](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-directions-swift/releases/tag/v2.7.0). ([#4332](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/4332))

## v2.4.2

### Packaging

* Fixed an issue where dependencies couldn't be resolved when using Swift Package Manager and Xcode 13.2.1. ([#4048](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/4048))
* MapboxNavigation now requires [MapboxMaps v10.5._x_](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/releases/tag/v10.5.1). ([#4048](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/4048))
* MapboxCoreNavigation now requires [MapboxNavigationNative v94._x_](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-native-ios/releases/tag/94.0.5). ([#4048](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/4048))
* MapboxCoreNavigation now requires [MapboxDirections v2.6._x_](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-directions-swift/releases/tag/v2.6.0). ([#4048](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/4048))

## v2.4.1

* Fixed an issue where the current road name, speed limit, and compass were missing from the map in CarPlay’s navigating activity. ([#3858](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3858))

## v2.4.0

### Pricing

* ❗ Starting with version 2.4.0, we are implementing a grace period of 30-seconds for all navigation sessions started by Nav SDK. A session will be counted only after this time period has surpassed. This allows you to reduce the cost of using the SDK during development and testing of your applications, as well as in production. Grace period is especially helpful to decrease the cost of short Free Drive session that are just a transition between Active Guidance sessions, or when a session is aborted right after it was started.

### Packaging

* MapboxNavigation now requires [MapboxMaps v10.4.1](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/releases/tag/v10.4.1). ([#3806](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3806))
* MapboxCoreNavigation now requires [MapboxNavigationNative v94._x_](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-native-ios/releases/tag/94.0.0). ([#3806](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3806))
* MapboxCoreNavigation now requires [MapboxDirections v2.4.0-rc.2](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-directions-swift/releases/tag/v2.4.0-rc.2). ([#3817](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3817))

### User interface

* Deprecated the optional `StyleManagerDelegate.styleManager(_:viewForApplying:)` method. All views appearance will be refreshed based on `StyleManager`. ([#3764](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3764))
* Fixed an issue where the map’s floating buttons are misaligned with its attribution button and sometimes untappable after rotating the device during turn-by-turn navigation. ([#3776](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3776))
* Fixed an issue where the top instruction banner couldn't be swiped back to the current one. ([#3785](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3785))
* Fixed an issue where the road name label shows wrong shield image when applying custom style under poor network connection. ([#3792](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3792))
* Added the `SpeedLimitView.shouldShowUnknownSpeedLimit` property which defines the view behavior if the `SpeedLimitView.speedLimit` property is `nil`. Setting this property to `true` will cause the view to display `"--"` as a speed limit instead of the `SpeedLimitView` being invisible. ([#3798](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3798))

### Location tracking

* Added the `RoadObject.Kind.railroadCrossing` enumeration case to represent a railroad crossing along the route. ([#3765](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3765))
* Throttled requests to the Mapbox Directions API while the user moves around in a parking lot that has not been mapped in detail. ([#3765](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3765))
* If the user backtracks from the beginning of one leg of the route to the end of the previous leg, the user is no longer considered to be off-route; instead, `RouteProgress.currentLegProgress` decrements and other properties follow suit. ([#3765](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3765))
* Fixed a crash starting turn-by-turn navigation on some routes that included bridges and restricted-access roads. ([#3765](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3765))
* Fixed an issue where the route line appeared to begin away from the user’s current location after the route was refreshed. ([#3781](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3781))

* Fixed an issue where `RouteControllerWillReroute` notification was incorrectly sent when a reroute was already in progress. ([#3772](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3772))
* Fixed an issue when `SimulatedLocationManager` could freeze the main thread when working with long routes. The manager now calls delegate methods from a background thread. ([#3672](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3672))
* Fixed an issue where initial puck position can be incorrect when `NavigationViewController` is presented. ([#3773](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3773))
* Fixed an issue where `UserHaloCourseView` was not correctly shown while changing `CLLocationManager.accuracyAuthorization` and `CLLocationManager.authorizationStatus`. ([#3804](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3804))

### Offline routing

* In [bilingual and multilingual areas](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Multilingual_names), spoken and visual instructions include street names and destinations in the user’s preferred language when that language is signposted. ([#3765](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3765))
* Fixed `Intersection.outletIndex` values that were off by one. ([#3765](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3765))
* High-occupancy vehicle roads in OpenStreetMap that lack a [`hov:minimum`](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:hov:minimum) tag are now assumed to be HOV&nbsp;2+ roads, requiring one or more passengers. ([#3765](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3765))
* Decreased memory usage when starting turn-by-turn navigation along a long-distance route. ([#3765](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3765))
* Fixed an issue where street names in spoken instructions could be go unpronounced if tagged with a [pronunciation](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:name:pronunciation). ([#3765](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3765))
* Added support for [the workaround](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-directions-swift/issues/662) for requesting a route that avoids an arbitrary set of coordinates. ([#3765](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3765))

### CarPlay

* Fixed an issue where CarPlay application was crashing during template dismissal on iOS 14 and higher. ([#3794](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3794))
* Added the ability to style each route line differently on CarPlay during route preview and active navigation using such delegate methods ([#3744](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3744)):
  * `CarPlayManagerDelegate.carPlayManager(_:routeLineLayerWithIdentifier:sourceIdentifier:for:)` to style the route.
  * `CarPlayManagerDelegate.carPlayManager(_:routeCasingLineLayerWithIdentifier:sourceIdentifier:for:)` to style the casing of the route.
* Added `CarPlayManager.previewRoutes(for:)` to provide the ability to preview routes based on response from Mapbox Directions. ([#3807](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3807))

### Other changes

* Added the `MapboxSpeechSynthesizer(remoteSpeechSynthesizer:)` initializer for creating a `MapboxSpeechSynthesizer` object that uses a custom `SpeechSynthesizer` instance. ([#3747](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3747))
* MapboxNavigationNative now sends messages to the Unified Logging subsystem `com.mapbox` for easier filtering. ([#3765](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3765))
* `HistoryRecording` static methods are deprecated in favor of instance methods. Using these instance variants on `RouteController` or `PassiveLocationManager` ensures correct history events recording and storing. ([#3791](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3791))
* Fixed a bug which caused `RouteOptions.profileIdentifier` to be ignored in active navigation. This may have caused elevated network usage. ([#3796](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3796))

## v2.3.0

The v2.2.0 release notes [clarified](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3652) that is an error to have more than one instance of `NavigationViewController`, `NavigationService`, or `RouteController` running simultaneously. Now you will receive a log message at the fault level helping you to spot the issue. To pause the debugger when the SDK detect the problematic situation, enable the “All Runtime Issues” breakpoint in Xcode. Learn more about breakpoints in [Xcode documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/setting-breakpoints-to-pause-your-running-app). ([#3740](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3740))

([#3704](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3704))
* Renamed the `LanesView.update(for:)`, `LanesView.show()` and `LanesView.hide()` methods to `LanesView.update(for:animated:duration:completion:)`, `LanesView.show(animated:duration:completion:)`, `LanesView.hide(animated:duration:completion:)`, respectively. ([#3704](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3704))
* Added the `InstructionsCardContainerView.separatorColor` and `InstructionsCardContainerView.highlightedSeparatorColor` to be able to change instruction card's separator colors. ([#3704](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3704))
* Added `routeShieldRepresentationKey` to the user info dictionary of `Notification.Name.passiveLocationManagerDidUpdate` posted by `PassiveLocationManager`, and the `Notification.Name.currentRoadNameDidChange` posted by `RouteController`. The corresponding value is a `MapboxDirections.VisualInstruction.Component.ImageRepresentation` object representing the road shield the user is currently traveling on. ([#3723](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3723))
* `InstructionsCardViewController` now has a flat appearance. ([#3704](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3704))
* Fixed a crash when approaching an intersection in which one of the lanes is a merge lane. ([#3699](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3699))

* Fixed the color of leg section headers in `StepsViewController` to switch between the day and night styles like the rest of the view controller. ([#3760](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3760))

### Location tracking

* Added an optional `datasetProfileIdentifier` argument to the `MapboxRoutingProvider(_:settings:datasetProfileIdentifier:)`, `PassiveLocationManager(directions:systemLocationManager:eventsManagerType:userInfo:datasetProfileIdentifier:),` `TilesetDescriptorFactory.getSpecificVersion(version:completionQueue:datasetProfileIdentifier:completion:)`, and `TilesetDescriptorFactory.getLatest(completionQueue:datasetProfileIdentifier:completion:)` methods for obtaining routing tiles optimized for a particular mode of transportation. Make sure to configure `MapboxRoutingProvider` and `TilesetDescriptorFactory` with the correct dataset profile if you customize `Directions.profileIdentifier`. ([#3717](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3717))
* Fixed a crash that sometimes occurred in Release configuration when initializing a `PassiveLocationManager` or `RouteController`. ([#3738](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3738))

### Offline routing

* If routing tiles in local storage are corrupted, the tiles are now redownloaded. ([#3705](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3705))
* Offline routes now respect the `RouteOptions.roadClassesToAllow` property. ([#3705](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3705))
* Fixed an issue where `Directions.calculateOffline(options:completionHandler:)` calculated the route by making a network request. ([#3702](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3702))
* Fixed an issue where offline directions contained instructions in English regardless of the `DirectionsOptions.locale` property. ([#3705](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3705))

### Other changes

* Added `CarPlayUserInfo` type alias for storing CarPlay-related user information. This type will be used by `CPRouteChoice` or `CPListItem` while presenting trip with multiple route choices or when selecting list item from search results, respectively. ([#3709](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3709))
* Added the `CarPlayManagerDelegate.carPlayManagerDidEndNavigation(_:byCanceling:)` method, which is similar to the existing `CarPlayManagerDelegate.carPlayManagerDidEndNavigation(_:)` method but indicates whether the user canceled the navigation session. ([#3731](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3731))
* Fixed an issue where changing `NavigationViewController.showsReportFeedback`, `NavigationViewController.showsSpeedLimits`, `NavigationViewController.detailedFeedbackEnabled`, `NavigationViewController.floatingButtonsPosition` and `NavigationViewController.floatingButtons` before presenting `NavigationViewController` had no effect. ([#3718](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3718))
* Fixed an issue where `SpeechSynthesizing.managesAudioSession` was ignored by `RouteVoiceController`. ([#3572](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3572))
* Fixed the gap between the end-of-route feedback panel and the bottom of the screen in landscape orientation. ([#3769](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3769))

## v2.2.0

### Packaging

* MapboxNavigation now requires [MapboxMaps v10.2._x_](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/releases/tag/v10.2.0). ([#3665](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3665))
* MapboxCoreNavigation now requires [MapboxDirections v2.2._x_](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-directions-swift/releases/tag/v2.2.0). ([#3694](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3694))
* MapboxCoreNavigation now requires [MapboxNavigationNative v83._x_](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-native-ios/releases/tag/83.0.0). ([#3683](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3683))

### Map

* Added `NavigationMapView.showsRestrictedAreasOnRoute` property which allows displaying on UI parts of a route which lie on restricted roads. This overlay is customisable through `NavigationMapView.routeRestrictedAreaColor`, `NavigationMapViewDelegate.navigationMapView(_:, restrictedAreasShapeFor:)` and `NavigationMapView.navigationMapView(_:, routeRestrictedAreasLineLayerWithIdentifier:, sourceIdentifier:)` methods. ([#3603](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3603))
* Fixed an issue where changing color of `NavigationMapView.maneuverArrowColor` and `NavigationMapView.maneuverArrowStrokeColor` did not work. ([#3633](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3633))
* Fixed an issue where the route line blinks when `NavigationMapView.showsRestrictedAreasOnRoute` is turned on during active navigation, and when `NavigationMapView.routeLineTracksTraversal` is set to `true`. ([#3654](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3654))
* Updated `RoutesPresentationStyle` to support the ability to present routes based on custom camera options. ([#3678](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3678))

### Location tracking

* Fixed an issue where customized `.puck2D` and `.puck3D` of `NavigationMapView.userLocationStyle` is not shown during simulated active navigation. ([#3674](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3674))
* Added the `NavigationLocationProvider.didUpdateLocations(locations:)` to send locations update to `MapView` and notify its `LocationConsumer`. ([#3674](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3674))
* When rerouting the user, if none of the new routes is very similar to the original route selection, the Router now follows the most optimal route, not a route that is only marginally similar. ([#3664](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3664))
* Exposed map matching status using new `MapMatchingResult` object which can be obtained through `RouteController.routeControllerProgressDidChange` and `PassiveLocationManager.passiveLocationManagerDidUpdate` notifications under `mapMatchingResultKey`. ([#3669](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3669))

### Banners and guidance instructions

* In landscape orientation, `NavigationViewController`’s top and bottom banners take up less space, leaving more room for the map. ([#3643](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3643))

### CarPlay

* Added the `CarPlayManagerDelegate.carPlayManagerWillEndNavigation(_:byCanceling:)` and `CarPlayNavigationViewControllerDelegate.carPlayNavigationViewControllerWillDismiss(_:byCanceling:)` methods for determining when `CarPlayNavigationViewController` is about to be dismissed. ([#3676](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3676))

### Other Changes

* Extracted `MapboxNavigationNative_Private` usage into a type alias to fix a compilation in Xcode 12.4. ([#3662](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3662))
* Fixed a bug where tapping `NavigationMapView` while it transitions the camera to or from `following/overview` states would leave it in `transitioning` state, and thus blocking switching to either mode. ([#3685](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3685))
* Fixed an issue where building extrusion highlighting was covering other items located on the map like POI and destination/arrival icons. ([#3692](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3692))

### Location tracking

* Fixed an issue where dismissing `NavigationViewController` could cause `RouteController` to crash or `PassiveLocationProvider` to behave like active turn-by-turn navigation. It is a programmer error to have more than one alive `NavigationViewController`, `NavigationService` or `RouteController` simultaneously. ([#3652](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3652))

## v2.1.0

### Pricing

* Fixed billing issues that might affect upgrading from v1._x_ to v2._x_. This update is strongly recommended. ([#3626](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3626))
* Fixed an issue where paused billing trip sessions might result in requests made inside MapboxNavigationNative to be billed per request. ([#3348](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3558))

### Packaging

* MapboxNavigation now requires [MapboxMaps v10.1.0](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/releases/tag/v10.1.0) or above. ([#3590](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3590))
* MapboxCoreNavigation now requires [MapboxDirections v2.1.0](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-directions-swift/releases/tag/v2.1.0) or above. ([#3590](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3590))
* MapboxCoreNavigation now requires [MapboxNavigationNative v80._x_](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-native-ios/releases/tag/80.0.0). ([#3590](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3590))

### Location tracking

* Added `RoutingProvider` to parameterize routing fetching and refreshing during active guidance sessions.  `Directions.calculateWithCache(options:completionHandler:)` and `Directions.calculateOffline(options:completionHandler)` functionality is deprecated by `MapboxRoutingProvider`. It is now recommended to use `MapboxRoutingProvider` to request or refresh routes instead of `Directions` object but you may also provide your own `RoutingProvider` implementation to `NavigationService`, `RouteController` or `LegacyRouteController`. Using `directions` property of listed above entities is discouraged, you should use corresponding `routingProvider` instead, albeit `Directions` also implements the protocol. ([#3261](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3261))
* Added the `PassiveLocationManager.rawLocation` and `PassiveLocationManager.location` properties to get the latest raw and idealized locations, respectively. ([#3474](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3474))
* Fixed an issue where `ReplayLocationManager` would crash if initialized with just one location. ([#3528](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3528))
* Added the `ReplayLocationManager.replayCompletionHandler` property that allows you to loop location. ([#3528](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3528), [3550](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3550))
* Added `RouteControllerNotificationUserInfoKey.headingKey` to the user info dictionary of `Notification.Name.routeControllerWillReroute`, `Notification.Name.routeControllerDidReroute`, and `Notification.Name.routeControllerProgressDidChange` notifications. ([#3620](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3620))
* Added a `Router.heading` property that may contain a heading from the location manager. ([#3620](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3620))
* Changed the behavior of `ReplayLocationManager` so that it doesn't loop locations by default. ([#3550](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3550))
* If the user walks away from the route, they may be rerouted onto a route that initially travels in the opposite direction. This is only the case along steps that require walking on foot. ([#3620](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3620))
* Fixed an issue where `ReplayLocationManager` didn't update location timestamps when a new loop started. ([#3550](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3550))
* Fixed the background location update issue during active navigation when using default `.courseView` for `NavigationMapView.userLocationStyle`. ([#3533](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3533))
* Fixed an issue where `UserPuckCourseView` is trimmed when using custom frame for `UserLocationStyle.courseView(_:)`. ([#3601](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3601))
* Fixed an issue where route line blinks when style is changed during active navigation. ([#3613](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3613))
* Fixed an issue where route line missing traffic colors after refresh or rerouting. ([#3622](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3622))
* Fixed an issue when user goes offline and the route line grows back when `NavigationViewController.routeLineTracksTraversal` enabled. When the distance of user location to the route is larger than certain distance threshold, the vanishing effect of route line would stop until the new route line gets generated. ([#3385](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3385))
* Fixed an issue where `RouteStepProgress.currentIntersection` was always returning invalid value, which in turn caused inability to correctly detect whether specific location along the route is in tunnel, or not. ([#3559](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3559))

### Banners and guidance instructions

* Added the `TopBannerViewController.lanesView`, `TopBannerViewController.nextBannerView`, `TopBannerViewController.statusView` and `TopBannerViewController.junctionView` properties. ([#3575](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3575))
* Added the `WayNameView.backgroundColor` and `WayNameView.borderWidth` properties for customizing how the current road name is labeled. ([#3534](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3534))
* The `InstructionsBannerViewDelegate` and `TopBannerViewControllerDelegate` protocols now conform to the `VisualInstructionDelegate` protocol. ([#3575](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3575))
* Fixed a crash when scrolling the guidance cards while the orientation changes. ([#3544](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3544))
* Fixed an issue where `VisualInstructionDelegate.label(_:willPresent:as:)` was never called. Your `NavigationViewControllerDelegate` class can now implement this method to customize the contents of a visual instruction during turn-by-turn navigation. ([#3575](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3575))
* Fixed an issue where certain dual- or triple-use lanes were blank in the tertiary instruction banner. ([#3569](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3569), [mapbox/navigation-ui-resources#26](https://github.com/mapbox/navigation-ui-resources/pull/26))
* Fixed an issue where dual-use slight turn lanes were sometimes depicted as normal turn lanes in the tertiary instruction banner. ([#3569](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3569), [mapbox/navigation-ui-resources#26](https://github.com/mapbox/navigation-ui-resources/pull/26))
* Setting the `WayNameView.isHidden` property to `true` now keeps the view hidden even after the user goes onto a named road. ([#3534](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3534))
* Fixed an issue where the user interface did not necessarily display distances in the same units as the route by default. `NavigationRouteOptions` and `NavigationMatchOptions` now set `DirectionsOptions.distanceMeasurementSystem` to a default value matching the `NavigationSettings.distanceUnit` property. ([#3541](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3541))

### Map

* Added the `NavigationViewController.usesNightStyleWhileInTunnel` and `CarPlayNavigationViewController.usesNightStyleWhileInTunnel` properties, which allow to disable dark style usage, while traversing the tunnels. ([#3559](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3559))
* Added the ability to change congestion color transition sharply or softly when `NavigationMapView.crossfadesCongestionSegments` changed during active navigation. ([#3466](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3466))
* While the user is walking, the map rotates according to the user’s heading instead of their course. ([#3620](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3620))
* Fixed an issue where the entire route line was colored as `NavigationMapView.routeCasingColor` instead of `NavigationMapView.trafficUnknownColor` when traffic congestion data was missing. ([#3577](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3577))
* Fixed an issue where `NavigationMapView.showcase(_:animated:)` was clipping unselected routes by renaming it to the `NavigationMapView.showcase(_:routesPresentationStyle:animated:)`, with an optional parameter to control whether the camera fits to unselected routes in addition to the selected route. ([#3556](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3556))
* Fixed an issue where on routes with large distances between current location and next manuever camera zoom level was too low. To control navigation camera zoom level use `IntersectionDensity.averageDistanceMultiplier` coefficient. ([#3616](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3616))

### CarPlay

* Added the `CarPlayActivity.panningInNavigationMode` case, which allows to track a state when user is panning a map view while actively navigating. ([#3545](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3545))
* Fixed an issue that caused the panning dismissal button to stop working on CarPlay. ([#3543](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3543))
* Fixed an issue which caused the inability to see `SpeedLimitView` and `CarPlayCompassView` when left-hand traffic mode is used on CarPlay. ([#3583](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3583))
* Added the `CarPlayMapViewController.wayNameView` and `CarPlayNavigationViewController.wayNameView` properties to show the current road name on CarPlay. `CarPlayNavigationViewController.compassView`, `CarPlayNavigationViewController.speedLimitView` and `CarPlayMapViewController.speedLimitView` are kept as strong references, thus available throughout the lifetime of a parent object. ([#3534](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3534))
* Fixed an issue when `NavigationMapView.crossfadesCongestionSegments` enabled but congestion color transition is still sharp in CarPlay. ([#3466](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3466))
* Fixed an issue when incorrect padding was used for `SpeedLimitView` and `CarPlayCompassView` for right-hand traffic mode on CarPlay. ([#3605](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3605))
* Added the ability to extrude or highlight building on CarPlay by setting the `CarPlayNavigationViewController.waypointStyle` property. ([#3564](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3564))
* Fixed a retain cycle in CarPlay implementation of a navigation map view that prevented `NavigationMapView` instances from being deallocated after CarPlay is stopped. ([#3552](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3552))

### Other changes

* Added the `SpeechSynthesizing.managesAudioSession` property to control if the speech synthesizer is allowed to manage the shared `AVAudioSession`. Set this value to false if you want to enable and disable the `AVAudioSession` yourself, for example, if your app plays background music. ([#3572](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3572))
* Fixed an issue when `SpeechSynthesizingDelegate.speechSynthesizer(_:willSpeak:)` callback was called at the wrong moment. ([#3572](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3572))
* Renamed the `Locale.usesMetric` property to `Locale.measuresDistancesInMetricUnits`. `Locale.usesMetric` is still available but deprecated. ([#3547](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3547))

## v2.0.1

* Added the `Notification.Name.didArriveAtWaypoint` constant for notifications posted when the user arrives at a waypoint. ([#3514](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3514))
* Added the `CarPlayManager.currentActivity` property to determine how a `CPTemplate` is being used. ([#3521](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3521))
* Fixed an issue where setting `StyleManager.styles` to an array of only one style did not immediately apply the style. ([#3508](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3508))
* Fixed an issue in CarPlay’s previewing activity where only the selected route was visible on the map, while other alternative routes were hidden. Now all the routes are visible simultaneously. ([#3511](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3511))
* Fixed an issue where the route line flashed when the user arrived at the destination if `NavigationViewController.routeLineTracksTraversal` was enabled. ([#3516](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3516))

### Banners and guidance instructions

* `InstructionsCardViewController` now adapts to `NightStyle`. ([#3503](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3503))
* Fixed an issue where `InstructionsCardViewController` installed duplicate Auto Layout constraints on each location update. ([#3503](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3503))

## v2.0.0

* Carthage v0.38 or above is now required for installing this SDK if you use Carthage. ([#3031](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3031))
* Added a Castilian Spanish localization. ([#3186](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3186))

#### Dependencies

* MapboxNavigation now depends on [MapboxMaps v10._x_](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/releases/tag/v10.0.0) instead of [Mapbox Maps SDK for iOS v6._x_](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native-ios/). Consult the “[Migrate to v10](https://docs.mapbox.com/ios/beta/maps/guides/migrate-to-v10/)” guide for tips on upgrading your runtime styling and other map-related code. ([#3413](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3413))

* MapboxCoreNavigation now depends on [MapboxMobileEvents v1._x_](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-events-ios/releases/tag/v1.0.0). The dependency on MapboxMobileEvents is subject to change or removal in a future minor release of MapboxCoreNavigation, so your Podfile, Cartfile, or Package.swift should not explicitly depend on MapboxMobileEvents. ([#3320](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3320))
* MapboxCoreNavigation now depends on [MapboxDirections v2._x_](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-directions-swift/releases/tag/v2.0.0). ([#3500](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3500))

### Map

* `NavigationMapView` is no longer a subclass of `MGLMapView`. To access `MGLMapView` properties and methods, use the `NavigationMapView.mapView` property. ([#2808](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2808))
* Added the `NavigationOptions.navigationMapView` property for reusing a custom map view within `NavigationViewController`. ([#3186](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3186)).
* Added the `NavigationMapView(frame:navigationCameraType:tileStoreLocation:)` initializer. ([#2826](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2826))
* Replaced the `NavigationMapView.navigationMapDelegate` and `NavigationMapView.navigationMapViewDelegate` properties with a single `NavigationMapView.delegate` property. ([#2808](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2808))
* Renamed the `NavigationViewController.mapView` property to `NavigationViewController.navigationMapView`. ([#2808](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2808))

([#3332](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3332))
* Renamed the `NavigationMapView.highlightBuildings(at:in3D:)` method to `NavigationMapView.highlightBuildings(at:in3D:completion:)`. ([#2827](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2827))

#### Camera

* Added the `NavigationMapView.navigationCamera` and `NavigationCamera.cameraStateTransition` properties for controlling the camera’s motion and the `NavigationViewportDataSource` class for configuring the viewport behavior based on the current location and nearby portions of the route line. Added the `ViewportDataSource` and `CameraStateTransition` protocols and the `NavigationViewportDataSourceOptions` struct for more granular customization. ([#2826](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2826), [#2944](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2944))
* Removed the `CarPlayNavigationViewController.tracksUserCourse` property and the `NavigationMapView.enableFrameByFrameCourseViewTracking(for:)`, `NavigationMapView.updateCourseTracking(location:camera:animated:)`, `NavigationMapView.setOverheadCameraView(from:along:for:)`, and `NavigationMapView.recenterMap()` methods in favor of the `NavigationMapView.navigationCamera` property. ([#2826](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2826))
* Removed the `NavigationMapView.defaultAltitude`, `NavigationMapView.zoomedOutMotorwayAltitude`, `NavigationMapView.longManeuverDistance`, `NavigationMapView.defaultPadding`, `NavigationMapView.courseTrackingDelegate`, and `NavigationViewController.pendingCamera` properties and the `NavigationMapViewDelegate.navigationMapViewUserAnchorPoint(_:)` method in favor of the `NavigationCamera.cameraStateTransition` property. ([#2826](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2826))
* `NavigationMapView.updateCourseTracking(location:camera:animated:)` accepts a `CameraOptions` instance instead of an `MGLMapCamera` object. ([#2808](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2808))
* Changed the `NavigationViewController.pendingCamera` property’s type from `MGLMapCamera` to `CameraOptions`. ([#2808](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2808))

* Eliminated redundant camera animations to conserve power. ([#3155](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3155), [#3172](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3172))
* Fixed the camera shaking in mobile and CarPlay during active navigation in simulation mode. ([#3393](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3393))

#### User location indicator

* Removed the `NavigationMapView.showsUserLocation` and `NavigationMapView.tracksUserCourse` properties in favor of `NavigationMapView.userLocationStyle`. ([#2808](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2808))
* Added the `NavigationMapView.userLocationStyle` property to customize how the user’s current location is displayed on the map. Set this property to `UserLocationStyle.puck2D(configuration:)` or `UserLocationStyle.puck3D(configuration:)` to use a location indicator layer (`LayerType.locationIndicator`) powered by the Mapbox Maps SDK instead of the default view-backed implementation. ([#2968](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2968))
* Removed the `NavigationMapView.userCourseView` property in favor of the associated value when `NavigationMapView.userLocationStyle` is set to `UserLocationStyle.courseView(_:)`. Added `NavigationMapView.reducedAccuracyActivatedMode` property, which allows to control current location styling based on accuracy authorization permission on iOS 14 and above. ([#2968](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2968), [#3384](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3384))
* If you need to customize the appearance of the user location indicator, you can subclass `UserPuckCourseView` and `UserHaloCourseView` as a starting point. ([#2968](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2968))
* Added the `UserHaloCourseView.haloBorderWidth` property for changing the width of the ring around the halo view. ([#3309](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3309))
* Fixed an issue where setting `UserPuckCourseView.puckColor` in a `Style` subclass had no effect. ([#3306](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3306))
* Fixed a memory leak in `UserCourseView`. ([#3120](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/issues/3120))
* Fixed the pitch issue of `UserHaloCourseView` when map tilted during active guidance navigation. ([#3407](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/issues/3407))
* Added the `UserPuckCourseView.minimizesInOverview` property, which allows to disable `UserPuckCourseView` minimization in case when navigation camera state is `NavigationCameraState.overview`. ([#3460](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/issues/3460))

#### Route overlay

* Removed the `NavigationAnnotation` class. ([#2808](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2808))
* Renamed the `MBRouteLineWidthByZoomLevel` property to `Constants.RouteLineWidthByZoomLevel` and changed its type to `Double` for keys and values. ([#2808](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2808))
* Renamed the `MBCurrentLegAttribute` and `MBCongestionAttribute` constants to `Constants.CurrentLegAttribute` and `Constants.CongestionAttribute`, respectively. ([#2808](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2808))
* Added the `NavigationMapView.navigationMapView(_:didAdd:pointAnnotationManager:)` and `NavigationViewController.navigationViewController(_:didAdd:pointAnnotationManager:)` delegate methods, which are called whenever a `PointAnnotation` is added to a `NavigationMapView` or `NavigationViewController`, respectively, to represent the final destination. Added the `NavigationMapView.pointAnnotationManager` property for managing point annotations. ([#2961](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2961), [#3109](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3109))
* When specifying the `legIndex` in `NavigationMapView.show(_:legIndex:)`, the route line for the specific route leg shows color-coded congestion segments, while other route legs are stroked with `NavigationMapView.routeCasingColor` by default. If the leg index is unspecified, all the route legs show color-coded congestion. During turn-by-turn navigation, the default specified route leg is the current route leg. You can override the route leg colors using properties such as `NavigationMapView.routeCasingColor` and `NavigationMapView.trafficHeavyColor`. Added the `NavigationMapView.showsCongestionForAlternativeRoutes` property to show congestion levels with different colors on alternative route lines. ([#2833](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2833), [#2887](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2887))
* Fixed an issue where the route line disappears when changing a `NavigationMapView`’s style. ([#3136](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3136))
* Renamed the `NavigationMapView.updateRoute(_:)` method to `NavigationMapView.travelAlongRouteLine(to:)`. Improved the performance of updating the route line to change color at the user’s location as they progress along the route. ([#3201](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3201)).
* Fixed an issue where the route line grows backwards when the `NavigationViewController.routeLineTracksTraversal` property is set to `true` and the user passes the destination. ([#3255](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3255))
* Fixed incorrect color-coded traffic congestion along the route line and incorrect speeds in the speed limit view after some time had elapsed after rerouting. ([#3344](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3344]))
* By default, there is no longer a subtle crossfade between traffic congestion segments along a route line. To reenable this crossfade, set the `NavigationMapView.crossfadesCongestionSegments` property to `true`. You can also adjust the length of this crossfade using the global variable `GradientCongestionFadingDistance`. ([#3153](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3153), [#3307](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3307))
* The duration annotations added by the `NavigationMapView.showRouteDurations(along:)` method are now set in the fonts you specify using the `NavigationMapView.routeDurationAnnotationFontNames` property. Use this property to specify a list of fallback fonts for better language support. ([#2873](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2873))
* Fixed an issue when route line was sometimes invisible after starting turn-by-turn navigation. ([#3205](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3205))

### Banners and guidance instructions

* Removed the `InstructionsBannerViewDelegate.didDragInstructionsBanner(_:)` method. ([#2808](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2808))
* Removed the `StatusView.delegate` and `StatusView.canChangeValue` properties and the `StatusViewDelegate` and `DeprecatedStatusViewDelegate` protocols. ([#2993](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2993))
* Removed the `BottomBannerViewController(delegate:)` initializer. ([#2993](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2993))
* The top banner can now show a wider variety of turn lane configurations, such as combination U-turn/left turn lanes and combination through/slight right turn lanes. ([#2882](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2882))
* Fixed an issue where the current road name label flashed when the camera state changed or the user traveled onto an unnamed road. ([#2958](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2958))
* Fixed an issue where the current road name label sometimes displayed the name of an intersecting road instead of the current road or blinked in and out. ([#3257](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3257))
* Fixed an issue where lane guidance icons would sometimes highlight the wrong arrow. ([#2942](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2942))
* Fixed an issue where instruction banners could appear in the wrong color after switching between `Style`s. ([#2977](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2977))
* Fixed an issue where `GenericRouteShield` images would ignore changing its foreground color in favor of a cached image. ([#3217](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3217))
* Fixed an issue where some banner instructions were occasionally skipped. ([#3265](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3265))
* Improved the current road name label’s performance and fixed a potential crash when updating it. ([#3340](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3340))
* Fixed an issue where arrival guidance card appears too early. ([#3383](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3383))
* Fixed an issue where the noncurrent guidance cards were highlighted. ([#3442](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3442))
* Fixed an issue where guidance cards for multi-leg routes could temporarily show fewer cards than available. ([#3451](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3451))

### Location tracking

* Added the `NavigationLocationProvider` class to conform to `LocationProvider` protocol, which depends on `NavigationLocationManager` to detect the user’s location as it changes during turn-by-turn navigation. `SimulatedLocationManager` and `ReplayLocationManager` can now be used with a standalone `NavigationMapView` through `NavigationMapView.mapView.location.overrideLocationProvider(with:)`. ([#3091](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3091))
* Added the `Notification.Name.currentRoadNameDidChange` to detect the road name posted by `RouteController`. ([#3266](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3266))
* `RouteController` and `PassiveLocationManager` now conform to the `NavigationHistoryRecording` protocol, which has methods for recording details about a trip for debugging purposes. ([#3157](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3157), [#3448](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3448))
* Renamed the `RouterDataSource.locationProvider` and `EventsManagerDataSource.locationProvider` properties to `RouterDataSource.locationManagerType` and `ActiveNavigationEventsManagerDataSource.locationManagerType`, respectively. ([#3199](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3199))
* Renamed the `Router.advanceLegIndex()` method to `Router.advanceLegIndex(completionHandler:)` and the `PassiveLocationDataSource.updateLocation(_:)` method to `PassiveLocationManager.updateLocation(_:completionHandler:)`. These methods are now asynchronous, and their completion handlers indicate whether the operation succeeded. ([#3342](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3342))
* Removed the `RouteLegProgress.upComingStep` property. ([#2993](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2993))
* Removed the `NavigationViewController.indexedRoute`, `NavigationService.indexedRoute`, and `Router.indexedRoute` properties in favor of `NavigationViewController.indexedRouteResponse`, `NavigationService.indexedRouteResponse`, and `Router.indexedRouteResponse`, respectively. Removed the `RouteProgress.indexedRoute` property. ([#3182](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3182))
* The `NavigationViewController.indexedRoute`, `NavigationService.indexedRoute`, `Router.indexedRoute`, and `RouteController.routeProgress` properties are no longer writable. Use the `Router.updateRoute(with:routeOptions:completion:)` method to manually reroute the user. ([#3159](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/#3159), [#3345](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3345]), [#3432](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3432))
* The `NavigationService.router` and `MapboxNavigationService.router` properties are no longer unsafe-unowned. ([#3055](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3055))
* Fixed unnecessary rerouting when calling the `NavigationService.start()` method. ([#3239](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3239))
* Fixed an issue where `RouteController` or `PassiveLocationManager` sometimes snapped the user’s location assuming a path that violated a turn restriction. ([#2808](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2808))
* Added `SimulationMode.inTunnels` to enable simulating user location when loosing GPS signal while traversing tunnels. Simulation mode for default navigation service now can be configured using `NavigationOptons.simulationMode`. ([#3314](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3314))
* Improved performance and decreased memory usage when downloading routing tiles. ([#2808](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2808))
* Fixed a crash when navigating along a route 0 meters long (for example, because two waypoints snap to the same location). ([#3387](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3387))
* Renamed the `Router.updateRoute(with:routeOptions:)` method to `Router.updateRoute(with:routeOptions:completion:)`. The method is now asynchronous, with a new completion handler that is called when the update has completed. ([#3432](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3432))
* Fixed an issue where `RouteController` sometimes incorrectly reported the user’s location as being off-route. ([#3432](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3432))
* Fixed a crash due to an invalid `RouteProgress` object. ([#3432](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3432))

#### Passive navigation

* Renamed `PassiveLocationManager` to `PassiveLocationProvider` and `PassiveLocationDataSource` to `PassiveLocationManager` for consistency with `NavigationLocationProvider` and `NavigationLocationManager`. ([#3091](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3091))
* `PassiveLocationProvider` now conforms to the `LocationProvider` protocol instead of `MGLLocationManager`. ([#2808](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2808))
* The `PassiveLocationProvider.delegate` property is now of type `LocationProviderDelegate` instead of `MGLLocationManagerDelegate`. ([#2808](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2808))
* Replaced `PassiveLocationManager.accuracyAuthorization()` was replaced with the `PassiveLocationProvider.accuracyAuthorization` property, which now returns `CLAccuracyAuthorization` instead of `MBNavigationAccuracyAuthorization`. ([#2808](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2808))
* Fixed a potential hang when `PassiveLocationManager` fails to download routing tiles. ([#2808](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2808))
* Renamed `PassiveLocationManager.startUpdatingLocation(completionHandler:)` to `PassiveLocationProvider.startUpdatingLocation()`. This method now runs synchronously like `CLLocationManager.startUpdatingLocation()`. ([#2823](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2823))

#### Rerouting

* `RouteOptions` no longer conforms to `NSCopying`. Use `JSONEncoder` and `JSONDecoder` to get a copy of the `RouteOptions` object round-tripped through JSON. ([#3484](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3484))
* Added the `NavigationViewControllerDelegate.navigationViewController(_:shouldPreventReroutesWhenArrivingAt:)` method, which is called each time the user arrives at a waypoint. By default, this method returns true and prevents rerouting upon arriving. ([#3195](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3195))
* Renamed `RouteOptions.without(waypoint:)` to `RouteOptions.without(_:)`. ([#3192](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3192))
* Rerouting now uses a snapped location instead of a raw location from Core Location. ([#3361](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3361), [#3644](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3644))
* Fixed an issue where a subclass of `NavigationRouteOptions` would turn into an ordinary `RouteOptions` when rerouting the user. ([#3192](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3192), [#3484](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3484))
* Fixed an issue where the `RouteController.indexedRouteResponse` property would remain unchanged after the user is rerouted. ([#3344](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3344]))
* Fixed an issue where the `IndexedRouteResponse.routeIndex` of the `NavigationService.indexedRouteResponse` property would reset to zero after the user is rerouted. ([#3345](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3345]))
* Fixed an issue where the user would be rerouted even if `NavigationViewControllerDelegate.navigationViewController(_:shouldRerouteFrom:)` returned `false`. To implement reroute after arrival behavior, return `true` from this method and `false` from `NavigationViewControllerDelegate.navigationViewController(_:shouldPreventReroutesWhenArrivingAt:)`, then set `NavigationViewController.showsEndOfRouteFeedback` to `false`. ([#3195](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3195))

#### Predictive caching and offline navigation

* A new predictive cache proactively fetches tiles which may become necessary if the device loses its Internet connection at some point during passive or active turn-by-turn navigation. Pass a `PredictiveCacheOptions` instance into the `NavigationOptions(styles:navigationService:voiceController:topBanner:bottomBanner:predictiveCacheOptions:)` initializer as you configure a `NavigationViewController`, or manually call `NavigationMapView.enablePredictiveCaching(options:)`. ([#2830](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2830))
* Added the `Directions.calculateOffline(options:completionHandler:)` and `Directions.calculateWithCache(options:completionHandler:)` methods, which incorporate routing tiles from the predictive cache when possible to avoid relying on a network connection to calculate the route. `RouteController` now also uses the predictive cache when rerouting. ([#2848](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2848))
* Fixed an issue where `PassiveLocationManager` and `RouteController` did not use the access token and host specified by `PassiveLocationDataSource.directions` and `RouteController.directions`, respectively. Added the `PredictiveCacheOptions.credentials` property for specifying the access token and host used for prefetching resources. ([#2876](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2876))
* Added the `NavigationMapView.mapTileStore`, `PassiveLocationManager.navigatorTileStore` and `RouteController.navigatorTileStore` properties for accessing `TileStore` objects that are responsible for downloading map and routing tiles. ([#2955](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2955))
* Added the `TilesetDescriptorFactory` class for checking routing tiles in a `TileStore`. The tile storage location is determined by the `NavigationSettings.tileStoreConfiguration` property. ([#3015](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3015), [#3164](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3164), [#3215](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3215))
* Added the `Notification.Name.navigationDidSwitchToFallbackVersion` and `Notification.Name.navigationDidSwitchToTargetVersion` notifications, which are posted when `PassiveLocationManager` and `RouteController` fall back to an older set of navigation tiles present in the current tile storage. ([#3014](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3014))
* Added the `NavigationSettings.directions` and `NavigationSettings.tileStoreConfiguration` properties for ensuring consistent caching between instances of `PassiveLocationManager` and `RouteController`. The `directions` argument of `PassiveLocationManager(directions:systemLocationManager:)`, `RouteController(alongRouteAtIndex:in:options:directions:dataSource:)`, and `MapboxNavigationService(routeResponse:routeIndex:routeOptions:directions:locationSource:eventsManagerType:simulating:routerType:)` now defaults to `NavigationSettings.directions`. ([#3215](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3215))
* Removed `Bundle.ensureSuggestedTileURLExists()`, `Bundle.suggestedTileURL` and `Bundle.suggestedTileURL(version:)`. ([#3425](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3425))

### Electronic horizon and route alerts

* While a `RouteController`, `PassiveLocationProvider`, or `PassiveLocationManager` is tracking the user’s location, you can get notifications about location changes that indicate relevant details in the _electronic horizon_ – the upcoming portion of the routing graph – such as the names of cross streets and upcoming speed limit changes. To receive this information call `RouteController.startUpdatingElectronicHorizon(with:)` or `PassiveLocationManager.startUpdatingElectronicHorizon(with:)` methods and observe the `Notification.Name.electronicHorizonDidUpdatePosition`, `Notification.Name.electronicHorizonDidEnterRoadObject`, `Notification.Name.electronicHorizonDidExitRoadObject`, and `Notification.Name.electronicHorizonDidPassRoadObject` notifications. Use the `RouteController.roadGraph` or `PassiveLocationManager.roadGraph` property to get more information about the edges contained in these notifications. ([#2834](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2834))
* **Note:** The Mapbox Electronic Horizon feature of the Mapbox Navigation SDK is in public beta and is subject to changes, including its pricing. Use of the feature is subject to the beta product restrictions in the Mapbox Terms of Service. Mapbox reserves the right to eliminate any free tier or free evaluation offers at any time and require customers to place an order to purchase the Mapbox Electronic Horizon feature, regardless of the level of use of the feature.
* Added the `RouteController.roadObjectMatcher` and `PassiveLocationManager.roadObjectMatcher` properties for creating user-defined road objects by matching location primitives to the road graph. ([#3004](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3004))
* Removed the `Alert` enumeration and the `RouteAlert.alert`, `RouteAlert.distance`, `RouteAlert.length`, `RouteAlert.beginCoordinate`, `RouteAlert.endCoordinate`, `RouteAlert.beginSegmentIndex`, and `RouteAlert.endSegmentIndex` properties in favor of a consolidated `RouteAlerts.roadObject` property. ([#2991](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2991))
* Added the `RouteController.startUpdatingElectronicHorizon(with:)`, `RouteController.stopUpdatingElectronicHorizon()`, `PassiveLocationManager.startUpdatingElectronicHorizon(with:)` and `PassiveLocationManager.stopUpdatingElectronicHorizon()` methods for managing electronic horizon updates. By default electronic horizon updates are disabled. ([#3475](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3475))

### CarPlay

* Removed the `CarPlayNavigationDelegate.carPlayNavigationViewControllerDidArrive(_:)` method. ([#2808](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2808))
* Renamed the `CarPlayManager.mapView` property to `CarPlayManager.navigationMapView`. ([#2808](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2808))
* Removed the `CarPlayManager.overviewButton` property. ([#2808](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2808))
* Removed the `CarPlayNavigationViewController.drivingSide` property. ([#2808](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2808))
* Added the `CarPlayManagerDelegate.carPlayManager(_:shouldPresentArrivalUIFor:)` and `CarPlayNavigationViewController.navigationService(_:didArriveAt:)` methods for determining when to present an arrival user interface. ([#3016](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3016))
* Renamed the `CarPlayNavigationDelegate` protocol to `CarPlayNavigationViewControllerDelegate` and the `CarPlayNavigationViewController.carPlayNavigationDelegate` property to `CarPlayNavigationViewController.delegate`. ([#3036](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3036))
* The `CarPlayNavigationViewController.styleManager` and `CarPlayMapViewController.styleManager` properties are now read-only. ([#3137](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3137))
* Moved the `CarPlaySearchController.searchTemplate(_:updatedSearchText:completionHandler:)`, `CarPlaySearchController.searchTemplate(_:searchTemplate:selectedResult:completionHandler:)` methods to the `CarPlaySearchControllerDelegate` protocol. Renamed the `CarPlaySearchControllerDelegate.resultsOrNoResults(_:limit:)` method to `CarPlaySearchControllerDelegate.searchResults(with:limit:)`. ([#2999](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2999))
* `CarPlaySearchControllerDelegate` now conforms to the `CPSearchTemplateDelegate` protocol. ([#2999](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2999))
* Added the `NavigationGeocodedPlacemark` struct, which is similar to MapboxGeocoder.swift’s `GeocodedPlacemark` struct but with the addition of the `NavigationGeocodedPlacemark.listItem()` method. Added the `RecentItem` struct to represent a recently selected search result. ([#2999](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2999))
* Added the `CarPlayMapViewControllerDelegate` protocol, which provides methods for reacting to events during the browsing and previewing activities. ([#3190](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3190))
* Added the `CarPlayMapViewControllerDelegate.carPlayMapViewController(_:didAdd:pointAnnotationManager:)`, `CarPlayNavigationViewControllerDelegate.carPlayNavigationViewController(_:didAdd:pointAnnotationManager:)` and `CarPlayManager.carPlayManager(_:didAdd:to:pointAnnotationManager:)` delegate methods, which will be called whenever the `PointAnnotation` representing the final destination is added to `CarPlayMapViewController`, `CarPlayNavigationViewController` and `CarPlayManager`, respectively. ([#3190](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3190))
* A speed limit indicator now appears on the map during the browsing activity. ([#3197](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3197))
* A speed limit indicator now can be fully hidden by using `SpeedLimitView.isAlwaysHidden` property. ([#3429](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3429))
* Renamed the `CarPlayManagerDelegate.carPlayManager(_:navigationServiceAlong:routeIndex:routeOptions:desiredSimulationMode:)` method to `CarPlayManagerDelegate.carPlayManager(_:navigationServiceFor:routeIndex:routeOptions:desiredSimulationMode:)`. It now returns an optional `NavigationService`; if it is `nil`, a `MapboxNavigationService` will be used by default. ([#3208](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3208))
* Renamed the `CarPlayManagerDelegate.carplayManagerShouldDisableIdleTimer(_:)` method to `CarPlayManagerDelegate.carPlayManagerShouldDisableIdleTimer(_:)`. ([#3208](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3208))
* Added the `CarPlayManagerDelegate.carPlayManager(_:templateWillAppear:animated:)`, `CarPlayManagerDelegate.carPlayManager(_:templateDidAppear:animated:)`, `CarPlayManagerDelegate.carPlayManager(_:templateWillDisappear:animated:)`, and `CarPlayManagerDelegate.carPlayManager(_:templateDidDisappear:animated:)` methods to pass through the corresponding methods from `CPInterfaceControllerDelegate`. ([#3219](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3219))
* Fixed an issue where `CPMapTemplate.tripEstimateStyle` uses dark appearance even if light appearance is selected. ([#3397](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3397))
* `CarPlayMapViewController` and `CarPlayNavigationViewController` are now subclassable. ([#3424](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3424))
* Added `CPInterfaceController.safePopTemplate(animated:)`, which allows to safely pop back a `CPTemplate` by a single level in the template navigation hierarchy. ([#3426](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3426))

### User feedback

* You can now solicit user feedback about `PassiveLocationManager` and `NavigationMapView` outside of active turn-by-turn navigation. Use `PassiveLocationManager.eventsManager` property of `NavigationEventsManager` type to create and send user feedback. You can use a `FeedbackViewController` to present the user with the same options as during turn-by-turn navigation. Alternatively, if you present a custom feedback UI, call the `NavigationEventsManager.createFeedback()` method and configure the resulting `FeedbackEvent` with any additional context. ([#3122](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3122), [#3322](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3322))
* The `ActiveNavigationEventsManagerDataSource.router`, `NavigationService.eventsManager`, and `MapboxNavigationService.eventsManager` properties are no longer unsafe-unowned. ([#3055](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3055))
* Removed the `EventsManager` type alias. ([#2993](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2993))
* Feedback events now include a snapshot of `NavigationViewController` that is taken sooner, when the problem is more likely to be apparent. ([#3049](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3049))
* You can now manage the feedback event lifecycle, allowing the user to submit additional details later. Use `NavigationEventsManager.createFeedback()` to create a `FeedbackEvent` and `NavigationEventsManager.sendActiveNavigationFeedback(_:type:description:)` to send it to Mapbox. `FeedbackEvent` conforms to the `Codable` protocol, so your application can store incomplete feedback across sessions if necessary. ([#3154](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3154), [#3318](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3318))
* To submit feedback during passive navigation, use `NavigationEventsManager.createFeedback()` to create a `FeedbackEvent` and `NavigationEventsManager.sendPassiveNavigationFeedback(_:type:description:)` to send it to Mapbox. This method accepts `PassiveNavigationFeedbackType` with feedback types specific to the passive navigation. ([#3154](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3154), [#3318](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3318))
* Added an optional `NavigationEventsManager.userInfo` property that can be sent with all navigation events. The new property can contain application metadata, such as the application name and version, that is included in each event to help Mapbox triage and diagnose unexpected behavior. ([#3007](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3007)).
* Fixed a missing feedback subtype description for `LooksIncorrectSubtype.incorrectSpeedLimit` and all “other” subtypes. ([#3238](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3238))
* Renamed the `FeedbackViewController(eventsManager:)` initializer to `FeedbackViewController(eventsManager:type:)`. You can now customize the view controller to show only the feedback types specific to passive navigation. ([#3323](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3323))
* Renamed the `FeedbackType` enumeration to `ActiveNavigationFeedbackType` and the `EventsManagerDataSource` protocol to `ActiveNavigationEventsManagerDataSource`. ([#3327](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3327))
* Renamed the user-facing feedback categories and subcategories for active turn-by-turn navigation that are represented at runtime by the `ActiveNavigationFeedbackType` enumeration. ([#3339]((https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3339))
* Added the ability to pass your own screenshot to the `NavigationEventsManager.createFeedback()` when a user submits a feedback. Screenshots help Mapbox to determine where issues exist for review and correction. ([#3380]((https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3380))
* Added `NavigationEventsManager.sessionId`, which allows getting session identifier used in feedback and other events. ([#3449](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3449))

### Other changes

* If your storyboard has a segue to `NavigationViewController` in Navigation.storyboard, you have to call the `NavigationViewController.prepareViewLoading(routeResponse:routeIndex:routeOptions:navigationOptions:)` method in your implementation of the `UIViewController.prepare(for:sender:)` method. ([#2974](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2974), [#3182](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3182))

* Added the `Notification.Name.navigationServiceSimulationDidChange` to detect when the navigation service changes the simulating status, including `MapboxNavigationService.NotificationUserInfoKey.simulationStateKey` and `MapboxNavigationService.NotificationUserInfoKey.simulatedSpeedMultiplierKey`. ([#3393](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3393)).
* By default, `NavigationRouteOptions` requests `AttributeOptions.maximumSpeedLimit` attributes along the route with the `DirectionsProfileIdentifier.walking` profile as with other profiles. ([#3496](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3496))

## v1.4.1

* Fixed the moment of custom feedback event creation. ([#2495](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2495))
* Fixed a bug in `RouterDelegate.router(_:shouldDiscard:)` handling. If you implemented this method, you will need to reverse the value you return. Previously, if you returned `true`, the `Router` wouldn't discard the location. ([#3058](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/3058))

* Fixed an issue where presenting `NavigationViewController` could sometimes interfere with view presentation in other windows. ([#2897](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2897))
* Added an optional `StyleManagerDelegate.styleManager(_:viewForApplying:)` method to determine which part of the view hierarchy is affected by a change to a different `Style`. ([#2897](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2897))
* Added the `NavigationViewController.styleManager`, `StyleManager.currentStyleType`, and `StyleManager.currentStyle` properties and the `StyleManager.applyStyle(type:)` method to manually change the UI style at any time. ([#2888](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2888))
* Fixed crash when switching between day / night modes. ([#2896](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2896))

* Fixed swiping for right-to-left languages for the Guidance Card UI to be more intuitive. ([#2724](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2724))
* `NavigationViewController` can now manage multiple status banners one after another. Renamed the `NavigationViewController.showStatus(title:spinner:duration:animated:interactive:)` method to `NavigationViewController.show(_:)` and added a corresponding `NavigationViewController.hide(_:)` method. Renamed the `NavigationStatusPresenter.showStatus(title:spinner:duration:animated:interactive:)` method to `NavigationStatusPresenter.show(_:)` and added a `NavigationStatusPresenter.hide(_:)` method. ([#2747](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2747))

## v1.2.1

([#2694](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2694), [#2770](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2770), [#2781](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2781))
* Installing MapboxCoreNavigation using CocoaPods no longer overrides the `EXCLUDED_ARCHS` build setting of your application’s target. Installing MapboxNavigation still overrides this setting. ([#2770](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2770))
* Added a Ukrainian localization. ([#2735](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2735))

### Map

* Added the ability to customize the floating buttons in navigation view. The floating buttons could be edited with `NavigationViewController.floatingButtons`, the position of the floating buttons could be edited with `NavigationViewController.floatingButtonsPosition`.  ([#2763](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2763))
* Fixed an issue which was causing clear map button disappearance in the example app when selecting the route. ([#2718](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2718))

* Created the `UserHaloCourseView` similar to `UserCourseView` for approximate location on iOS 14 during the navigation to represent user location. Allow the switch between `UserHaloCourseView` and `UserCourseView` when precise mode is changed. ([#2664](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2664))
* Added option to show route duration callouts when previewing route alternatives ([#2734](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2734)):
  * `NavigationMapView.showRouteDurations(along:)` to show duration annotation callouts on the map for the provided routes.
  * `NavigationMapView.removeRouteDurations()` to remove any route duration annotations currently displayed on the map.

### Instruction banners

* Fixed an issue which was preventing the ability to customize the bottom banner height. ([#2705](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2705))

* Fixed an issue where incorrect speed multiplier value was shown after arriving to the intermediate waypoint. ([#2710](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2710))


## v1.0.0

### Packaging

* By default, usage of Mapbox APIs is now [billed](https://www.mapbox.com/pricing/#navmaus) together based on [monthly active users](https://docs.mapbox.com/help/glossary/monthly-active-users/) rather than individually by HTTP request. Learn more in the [pricing guide](https://docs.mapbox.com/ios/navigation/guides/pricing/). ([#2405](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2405))
* Carthage v0.35 or above is now required for installing this SDK if you use Carthage. ([`81a36d0`](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/commit/81a36d090e8a0602b7144ee7697b7857675b496f))
* MapboxNavigation depends on Mapbox Maps SDK for iOS v6.0.0, and MapboxCoreNavigation depends on builds of MapboxNavigationNative and MapboxCommon that require authentication. Before CocoaPods or Carthage can download Mapbox.framework, MapboxNavigationNative.framework, and MapboxCommon.framework, you need to create a special-purpose access token. See [the updated installation instructions in the readme](./README.md#installing-the-latest-prerelease) for more details. ([#2437](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2437), [#2477](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2477))
* If you install this SDK using Carthage, you need to also add MapboxCommon.framework to your application target’s Embed Frameworks build phase. ([#2477](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2477))
* Xcode 11.4.1 or above is now required for building this SDK from source. ([#2417](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2417))
* Added Greek and Turkish localizations. ([#2385](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2385), [#2475](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2475))
* Upgraded to [MapboxDirections v1.0.0](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-directions-swift/releases/tag/v1.0.0), [MapboxSpeech v1.0.0](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-speech-swift/releases/tag/v1.0.0), and [Turf v1.0.0](https://github.com/mapbox/turf-swift/releases/tag/v1.0.0). ([#2646](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2646))

### Map

* The `MGLStyle.navigationDayStyleURL` and `MGLStyle.navigationNightStyleURL` properties contain URLs to the Mapbox Navigation Day and Night v5 styles, both of which show traffic congestion lines on all roads by default. The traffic congestion layer is appropriate for a preview map; to tailor the style to turn-by-turn navigation, set `MGLMapView.showsTraffic` to `false`. ([#2523](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2523))
* A portion of the route line now disappears behind the user puck as the user travels along the route during turn-by-turn navigation if `NavigationViewController.routeLineTracksTraversal` is set to `true`. ([#2377](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2377))
* Ability to hide the route line behind the user puck on CarPlay can be enabled by setting `CarPlayNavigationViewController.routeLineTracksTraversal` to `true`. ([#2601](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2601))
* Traffic congestion segments along the route line and the estimated arrival time periodically update to reflect current conditions when using the `DirectionsProfileIdentifier.automobileAvoidingTraffic` profile. These updates correspond to the new `Notification.Name.routeControllerDidRefreshRoute` notification, `NavigationServiceDelegate.navigationService(_:didRefresh:)` method, and `NavigationViewControllerDelegate.navigationViewController(_:didRefresh:)` method. To disable these updates, set `RouteOptions.refreshingEnabled` to `false`. ([#2366](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2366))
* A building at the destination waypoint can be extruded in 3D and highlighted for emphasis and recognizability. To enable building extrusion or highlighting, set the `NavigationViewController.waypointStyle` property. For a standalone map view that is not part of `NavigationViewController`, call the `NavigationMapView.highlightBuildings(at:in3D:)` method to highlight the destination building at a specific coordinate and `NavigationMapView.unhighlightBuildings()` to reverse this effect. ([#2535](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2535))
* Replaced the `MGLStyle.navigationPreviewDayStyleURL` and `MGLStyle.navigationGuidanceDayStyleURL` properties with `MGLStyle.navigationDayStyleURL`, and replaced `MGLStyle.navigationPreviewNightStyleURL` and `MGLStyle.navigationGuidanceNightStyleURL` with `MGLStyle.navigationNightStyleURL`. ([#2523](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2523))
* Replaced the `MGLStyle.navigationGuidanceDayStyleURL(version:)` and `MGLStyle.navigationGuidanceNightStyleURL(version:)` methods with `MGLStyle.navigationDayStyleURL(version:)` and `MGLStyle.navigationNightStyleURL(version:)` respectively, removed the `MGLStyle.navigationPreviewDayStyleURL(version:)` and `MGLStyle.navigationPreviewNightStyleURL(version:)` methods. ([#2567](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2567))
* Removed the `NavigationViewControllerDelegate.navigationViewController(_:imageFor:)` and `NavigationViewControllerDelegate.navigationViewController(_:viewFor:)` methods in favor of `MGLMapViewDelegate.mapView(_:imageFor:)` and `MGLMapViewDelegate.mapView(_:viewFor:)`, respectively. ([#2396](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2396))
* Removed `NavigationMapViewDelegate.navigationMapView(_:routeStyleLayerWithIdentifier:source:)`, `NavigationMapViewDelegate.navigationMapView(_:routeCasingStyleLayerWithIdentifier:source:)` in favor of four new delegate methods to customize the route styling ([#2377](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2377)):
  * `NavigationMapViewDelegate.navigationMapView(_:mainRouteStyleLayerWithIdentifier:source:)` to style the main route.
  * `NavigationMapViewDelegate.navigationMapView(_:mainRouteCasingStyleLayerWithIdentifier:source:)` to style the casing of the main route.
  * `NavigationMapViewDelegate.navigationMapView(_:alternativeRouteStyleLayerWithIdentifier:source:)` to style alternative routes.
  * `NavigationMapViewDelegate.navigationMapView(_:alternativeRouteCasingStyleLayerWithIdentifier:source:)` to style the casing of alternative routes.
* Removed the deprecated `NavigationMapView.showRoutes(_:legIndex:)` method in favor of `NavigationMapView.show(_:legIndex:)` and `NavigationMapView.showWaypoints(_:legIndex:)` in favor of `NavigationMapView.showWaypoints(on:legIndex:)`. ([#2539](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2539))
* Fixed an issue where the casing for the main route would not overlap alternative routes. ([#2377](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2377))
* Fixed memory leaks after disconnecting the application from CarPlay. ([#2470](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2470))
* Fixed issue which was causing incorrect alignment of `MGLMapView.attributionButton` and `MGLMapView.logoView`. ([#2613](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2613))

### Visual and spoken instructions

* As the user approaches certain junctions, an enlarged illustration of the junction appears below the top banner to help the user understand a complex maneuver. These junction views only appear when the relevant data is available. Contact your Mapbox sales representative or [support team](https://support.mapbox.com/) for access to the junction views feature. ([#2408](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2408))
* Replaced `RouteVoiceController` and `MapboxVoiceController` with `MultiplexedSpeechSynthesizer`. `MultiplexedSpeechSynthesizer` coordinates multiple cascading speech synthesizers. By default, the controller still tries to speak instructions via the Mapbox Voice API (`MapboxSpeechSynthesizer`) before falling back to VoiceOver (`SystemSpeechSynthesizer`), but you can also provide your own speech synthesizer that conforms to the `SpeechSynthesizing` protocol. ([#2348](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2348))
* Added an alternative presentation for maneuver instructions that resembles swipeable user notification cards. To replace the conventional `TopBannerViewController` presentation with the cardlike presentation, create an instance of `InstructionsCardViewController` and pass it into the `NavigationOptions(styles:navigationService:voiceController:topBanner:bottomBanner:)` method. ([#2149](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2149), [#2296](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2296), [#2627](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2627))

### Feedback

* The user can optionally provide more detailed feedback during turn-by-turn navigation. After tapping the feedback button and selecting a feedback type, the user is taken to a second screen for selecting from among multiple subtypes. Set the  `FeedbackViewController.detailedFeedbackEnabled` property to `true` to enable two-step feedback. ([#2544](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2544))
* Reorganized `FeedbackType` cases ([#2419](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2419)):
   * Removed `FeedbackType.accident`, `FeedbackType.hazard`, `FeedbackType.reportTraffic`, and `FeedbackType.mapIssue`.
   * Renamed `FeedbackType.roadClosed` and `FeedbackType.notAllowed` to `FeedbackType.roadClosure(subtype:)` and `FeedbackType.illegalRoute(subtype:)`, respectively.
   * Renamed `FeedbackType.routingError` to `FeedbackType.routeQuality(subtype:)`.
   * Renamed `FeedbackType.confusingInstruction` to `FeedbackType.confusingAudio(subtype:)`.
   * Added `FeedbackType.incorrectVisual(subtype:)`, `FeedbackType.routeQuality(subtype:)`, and `FeedbackType.positioning(subtype:)`.
   * `FeedbackType.missingRoad` is now represented as `FeedbackType.routeQuality(subtype:)` with a subtype of `RouteQualitySubtype.routeIncludedMissingRoads`.
   * `FeedbackType.missingExit` is now represented as `FeedbackType.incorrectVisual(subtype:)` with a subtype of `IncorrectVisualSubtype.exitInfoIncorrect`.
* `FeedbackViewController` no longer dismisses automatically after 10 seconds. ([#2420](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2420))
* Refreshed the feedback type icons. ([#2419](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2419), [#2421](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2421))
* Fixed warnings in Interface Builder that prevented styling of UI components in `EndOfRouteViewController`. ([#2518](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2518))

### User location

* Improved the accuracy of location tracking and off-route detection. ([#2319](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2319))
* Added the `PassiveLocationManager` class for use with the `MGLMapView.locationManager` property. Unlike `CLLocationManager`, this class causes the map view to display user locations snapped to the road network, just like during turn-by-turn navigation. To receive these locations without an `MGLMapView`, use the `PassiveLocationDataSource` class and implement the `PassiveLocationDataSourceDelegate.passiveLocationDataSource(_:didUpdateLocation:rawLocation:)` method or observe `Notification.Name.passiveLocationDataSourceDidUpdate` notifications. ([#2410](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2410))
* The `NavigationViewController.route` and `NavigationService.route` properties are now read-only. To change the route that the user is traveling along, set the `NavigationViewController.indexedRoute` or `NavigationService.indexedRoute` property instead, pairing the route with the index of the route in the original `RouteResponse` object. ([#2366](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2366))
* The following methods now require a route index to be passed in as an argument ([#2366](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2366)):
   * `NavigationViewController(for:routeIndex:routeOptions:navigationOptions:)`
   * `NavigationViewController(route:routeIndex:routeOptions:navigationService:)`
   * `CarPlayManagerDelegate.carPlayManager(_:navigationServiceAlong:routeIndex:routeOptions:desiredSimulationMode:)`
   * `MapboxNavigationService(route:routeIndex:routeOptions:)`
   * `MapboxNavigationService(route:routeIndex:routeOptions:directions:locationSource:eventsManagerType:simulating:routerType:)`
   * `RouteProgress(route:routeIndex:options:legIndex:spokenInstructionIndex:)`
   * `RouteProgress(route:routeIndex:options:legIndex:spokenInstructionIndex:)`
   * `Router(along:routeIndex:options:directions:dataSource:)`
   * `RouteController(along:routeIndex:options:directions:dataSource:)`
* Fixed an issue where location tracking would pause at the beginning of a route after setting `RouteOptions.shapeFormat` to `RouteShapeFormat.polyline` or `RouteShapeFormat.geoJSON`. Note that you most likely do not need to override the default value of `RouteShapeFormat.polyline6`: this is the least bandwidth-intensive format, and `Route.shape` and `RouteStep.shape` are set to `LineString`s regardless. ([#2319](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2319))
* Fixed an issue where various delegate methods omitted `CLLocation.courseAccuracy` and `CLLocation.speedAccuracy` properties from passed-in `CLLocation` objects when using `RouteController`, even when these properties are provided by Core Location on iOS 13.4 and above. ([#2417](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2417))
* Fixed issues where the user puck would sometimes drift away from the route line even though the user was following the route. ([#2412](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2412), [#2417](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2417))
* Fixed an issue where `RouteController` took longer than usual to detect that the user had gone off-route. ([#2412](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2412))
* Fixed an issue where `RouteController` would detect that the user had gone off-route due to a single errant location update. ([#2412](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2412), [#2417](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2417))
* Fixed an issue where the camera and user puck would cut a corner when making a turn at speed. ([#2412](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2412))
* Fixed an issue where `RouteController` became too sensitive to the user going off-route near “intersections” that the Mapbox Directions API synthesizes at road classification changes, such as at either end of a tunnel. ([#2412](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2412))
* If the user’s raw course as reported by Core Location differs significantly from the direction of the road ahead, the camera and user puck are oriented according to the raw course. ([#2417](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2417))
* `RouteController` now tracks the user’s location more accurately within roundabouts. ([#2417](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2417))
* Fixed an issue where departure instructions were briefly missing when beginning turn-by-turn navigation. ([#2417](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2417))
* Removed the `RouteController.projectedLocation(for:)` method in favor of `RouteController.location`. It is no longer possible to predict the user’s location at an arbitrary time. ([#2610](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2610))
* Renamed the `Router.advanceLegIndex(location:)` method to `Router.advanceLegIndex()`. It is no longer possible to advance to an arbitrary leg using this method. ([#2610](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2610))

### Other changes

* The `RouteProgress.congestionTravelTimesSegmentsByStep` and `RouteProgress.congestionTimesPerStep` properties are now read-only. ([#2624](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2624))
* Deprecated `NavigationDirectionsCompletionHandler`, `OfflineRoutingError`, `UnpackProgressHandler`, `UnpackCompletionHandler`, `OfflineRouteCompletionHandler`, and `NavigationDirections`. Use `Directions` instead of `NavigationDirections` to calculate a route. ([#2509](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2509))

## v0.40.0

### Packaging
* This SDK can no longer be used in applications written in pure Objective-C. If you need to use this SDK’s public API from Objective-C code, you will need to implement a wrapper in Swift that bridges the subset of the API you need from Swift to Objective-C. ([#2230](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2230))
* Added a new dependency on MapboxAccounts to prepare for upcoming improvements to how Mapbox [bills](https://www.mapbox.com/pricing/) this SDK’s usage of Mapbox APIs. If you use Carthage to install this SDK, remember to add MapboxAccounts.framework to the “Frameworks, Libraries, and Embedded Content” section and the input and output file lists of Carthage’s Run Script build phase. ([#2151](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2151))
* Upgraded to [Mapbox Maps SDK for iOS v5.6._x_](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native-ios/releases/tag/ios-v5.6.0). ([#2302](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2302))
* Fixed sporadic build failures after installing this SDK using CocoaPods. ([#2368](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2368))

### Top and bottom banners
* Removed `BottomBannerViewController(delegate:)` in favor of `BottomBannerViewController()` and the `BottomBannerViewController.delegate` property’s setter. ([#2297](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2297))
* Removed the `StatusView.canChangeValue` property in favor of `StatusView.isEnabled`. ([#2297](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2297))

### Map
* `UserCourseView` is now a type alias of the `UIView` class and the `CourseUpdatable` protocol rather than a protocol in its own right. ([#2230](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2230))
* Renamed `NavigationMapView.showRoutes(_:legIndex:)` to `NavigationMapView.show(_:legIndex:)`. ([#2230](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2230))
* Renamed `NavigationMapView.showWaypoints(_:legIndex:)` to `NavigationMapView.showWaypoints(on:legIndex:)`. ([#2230](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2230))
* Removed the `NavigationMapView.navigationMapDelegate` property in favor of `NavigationMapView.navigationMapViewDelegate`. ([#2297](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2297))
* Added a speed limit indicator to the upper-left corner of the map view during turn-by-turn navigation (upper-right corner in CarPlay). To hide the speed limit indicator, set the `NavigationViewController.showsSpeedLimits` property to `false`. To customize the indicator’s colors, configure `SpeedLimitView`’s appearance proxy inside a `Style` subclass. ([#2291](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2291))
* Fixed an issue where the current road name label contained an oversized route shield when the current map style was a custom style created in Mapbox Studio. ([#2357](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2357))

### Spoken instructions
* Removed `MapboxVoiceController.play(_:)` in favor of `MapboxVoiceController.play(instruction:data:)`. ([#2230](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2230), [#2297](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2297))
* The `MapboxVoiceController.speakWithDefaultSpeechSynthesizer(_:error:)` and `VoiceControllerDelegate.voiceController(_:spokenInstructionsDidFailWith:)` methods now accept a `SpeechError` instance instead of an `NSError` object. ([#2230](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2230))
* Added the `VoiceControllerDelegate.voiceController(_:didFallBackTo:becauseOf:)` method for detecting when the voice controller falls back to `AVSpeechSynthesizer`. ([#2230](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2230))

### User location
* Removed the `NavigationViewController.routeController` property and `LegacyRouteController(along:directions:dataSource:eventsManager:)`. To use `LegacyRouteController` instead of the default `RouteController` class, pass that type into `MapboxNavigationService(route:directions:locationSource:eventsManagerType:simulating:routerType:)`, pass the `MapboxNavigationService` object into `NavigationOptions(styles:navigationService:voiceController:topBanner:bottomBanner:)`, and pass the `NavigationOptions` object into `NavigationViewController(route:navigationService:)`. To access `LegacyRouteController`, use the `NavigationViewController.navigationService` and `NavigationService.router` properties and cast the value of `NavigationService.router` to a `LegacyRouteController`. ([#2297](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2297))
* Removed the `NavigationViewController.locationManager` and `LegacyRouteController.locationManager` properties in favor of `NavigationService.locationManager`. ([#2297](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2297))
* Removed `RouteLegProgress.upComingStep` in favor of `RouteLegProgress.upcomingStep`. ([#2297](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2297))
* Removed the `RouteProgress.nearbyCoordinates` property in favor of `RouteProgress.nearbyShape`. ([#2275](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2275), [#2275](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2275))
* Removed the `LegacyRouteController.tunnelIntersectionManager` property. ([#2297](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2297))

### Other changes
* Various delegate protocols now provide default no-op implementations for all their methods and conform to the `UnimplementedLogging` protocol, which can inform you at runtime when a delegate method is called but has not been implemented. This replaces the use of optional methods, which are disallowed in pure Swift protocols. Messages are sent through Apple Unified Logging and can be disabled globally through [Unifed Logging](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/os/logging#2878594), or by overriding the delegate function with a no-op implementation. ([#2230](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2230))
* Removed `NavigationViewController(for:styles:navigationService:voiceController:)` and `NavigationViewController(for:directions:styles:routeController:locationManager:voiceController:eventsManager:)` in favor of `NavigationViewController(route:options:)`. ([#2297](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2297))
* Removed the `EventsManager` type alias in favor of the `NavigationEventsManager` class. ([#2297](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2297))
* Removed the `NavigationViewController.eventsManager` and `LegacyRouteController.eventsManager` properties in favor of `NavigationService.eventsManager`. ([#2297](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2297))
* Removed the `NavigationViewController.carPlayManager(_:didBeginNavigationWith:window:delegate:)` and `NavigationViewController.carPlayManagerDidEndNavigation(_:window:)` methods. To mirror CarPlay navigation on the main device, present and dismiss a `NavigationViewController` in the `CarPlayManagerDelegate.carPlayManager(_:didBeginNavigationWith:)` and `CarPlayManagerDelegate.carPlayManagerDidEndNavigation(_:)` methods, respectively. ([#2297](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2297))
* When Dark Mode is enabled, user notifications now draw maneuver icons in white instead of black for better contrast. ([#2283](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2283))
* Added the `RouteLegProgress.currentSpeedLimit` property. ([#2114](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2114))
* Added convenience initializers for converting Turf geometry structures into `MGLShape` and `MGLFeature` objects such as `MGLPolyline` and `MGLPolygonFeature`. ([#2308](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2308))
* Fixed an issue where the “End Navigation” button in the end-of-route feedback panel appeared in English regardless of the current localization. ([#2315](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2315))

## v0.39.0

* Upgraded to [Mapbox Maps SDK for iOS v5.5.1](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native-ios/releases/tag/ios-v5.5.1). (#2341)
* Fixed an issue where the spoken instructions always fell back to VoiceOver when the `MGLMapboxAPIBaseURL` key was set in the Info.plist file. ([#2329](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2329))
* Fixed a crash when setting certain properties of a `Style` subclass to a dynamic color. ([#2338](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2338))

## v0.38.3

* Fixed a crash on launch if this SDK is installed using Carthage. ([#2317](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2317))
* Fixed a crash when the first visual instruction contained a route shield or exit number and the application’s user interface was written in SwiftUI. ([#2323](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2323))
* Fixed an issue where a black background could appear under the arrow in a `ManeuverView` regardless of the view’s `backgroundColor` property. ([#2279](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2279))
* Fixed an issue where the wrong style was applied to exit numbers in the top banner and for subsequent maneuver banners in CarPlay, resulting in poor contrast. ([#2280](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2280))

## v0.38.2

* Fixed a crash on launch if this SDK is installed using Carthage. ([#2301](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2301))

## v0.38.1

* Fixed an issue where user notifications displayed right turn arrows for left turn maneuvers. ([#2270](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2270))

## v0.38.0

* This library now requires a minimum deployment target of iOS 10.0 or above. iOS 9._x_ is no longer supported. ([#2206](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2206))
* Fixed an issue where the user puck appeared farther up the screen than the actual user location even while the camera pivoted around the user location at turns. ([#2211](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2211))
* Lock screen notifications are presented more reliably and more closely resemble instruction banners. ([#2206](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2206))
* Fixed an issue where manually incrementing `RouteProgress.legIndex` could lead to undefined behavior. ([#2229](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2229))
* `DistanceFormatter` now inherits directly from `Formatter` rather than `LengthFormatter`. ([#2206](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2206))
* Fixed an issue where `DistanceFormatter.attributedString(for:withDefaultAttributes:)` set `NSAttributedString.Key.quantity` to the original distance value rather than the potentially rounded value represented by the attributed string. ([#2206](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2206))

## v0.37.1

* Fixed a crash on launch if this SDK is installed using Carthage. ([#2301](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2301))

## v0.37.0

* Fixed an issue where a second swipe down on the top banner causes an open `StepsTableViewController` to animate incorrectly. ([#2197](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2197))
* Added the `NavigationViewControllerDelegate.navigationViewController(_:didUpdate:location:rawLocation:)` method for capturing progress updates without having to inject a class between the `NavigationViewController` and the `NavigationService`. ([#2224](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2224))
* Fixed an issue where the bottom banner can disappear when presenting in `UIModalPresentationStyle.fullScreen` in iOS 13.  ([#2182](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2182))

## v0.36.0

* Fixed an issue where InstructionsBannerView remained the same color after switching to a day or night style. ([#2178](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2178))
* Fixed an issue where `NavigationMapView` showed routes without congestion attributes, such as `MBDirectionsProfileIdentifier.walking` routes, as translucent lines, even if the route had only one leg. ([#2193](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2193))
* Fixed an issue where the “iPhone Volume Low” banner would persist until replaced by another banner about simulation or rerouting. ([#2183](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2183))

* Fixed an issue where `LegacyRouteController` failed to call `NavigationServiceDelegate.navigationService(_:didPassSpokenInstructionPoint:routeProgress:)` and omitted `RouteControllerNotificationUserInfoKey.spokenInstructionKey` from `Notification.Name.routeControllerDidPassSpokenInstructionPoint` notifications. ([#2089](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2089))
* Fixed an issue where `SimulatedLocationManager`’s distance did not update in response to updating the `Router`’s route, causing the user puck to be snapped to an invalid location on the new route. ([#2096](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2096))
* `NavigationMatchOptions.shapeFormat` now defaults to `RouteShapeFormat.polyline6` for consistency with `NavigationRouteOptions` and compatibility with the `RouteController`. ([#2084](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2084))

* The `MGLShapeSourceOptions.lineDistanceMetrics` property has been temporarily disabled from the route line shape source due to a crash. This means it isn’t possible to set the `MGLLineStyleLayer.lineGradient` property on the route line style layers. ([#1886](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1886))

## v0.25.0 (November 22, 2018)

### CarPlay

* Renamed `CarPlayManager.calculateRouteAndStart(from:to:completionHandler:)` to `CarPlayManager.previewRoutes(between:completionHandler:)` and added a `CarplayManager.previewRoutes(to:completionHandler)`, as well as a `CarPlayManager.previewRoutes(for:completionHandler:)` method that accepts an arbitrary `NavigationRouteOptions` object. ([#1841](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1841))
* Fixed an issue causing `UserCourseView` to lag behind `NavigationMapView` whenever the map’s camera or content insets change significantly or when the map rotates. ([#1838](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1838))
* Renamed `CarPlayManager(_:)` to `CarPlayManager(styles:directions:eventsManager:)` and `CarPlayNavigationViewController(with:mapTemplate:interfaceController:manager:styles:)` to `CarPlayNavigationViewController(navigationService:mapTemplate:interfaceController:manager:styles:)`. These initializers now accept an array of `Style` objects to apply throughout the CarPlay interface, similar to `NavigationViewController`. You can also change the styles at any time by setting the `CarPlayManager.styles` property. ([#1836](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1836))
* `CarPlayManager(styles:directions:eventsManager:)` also allows you to pass in a custom `Directions` object to use when calculating routes. ([#1834](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1834/))
* Removed the `StyleManager(_:)` initializer. After initializing a `StyleManager` object, set the `StyleManager.delegate` property to ensure that the style manager’s settings take effect. ([#1836](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1836))
* Added `CarPlayManager.mapView` and `CarPlayNavigationViewController.mapView` properties. ([#1852](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1852))

## v0.24.0 (November 7, 2018)

* It is now safe to set the `NavigationMapView.delegate` property of the `NavigationMapView` in `NavigationViewController.mapView`. Implement `MGLMapViewDelegate` in your own class to customize annotations and other details. ([#1601](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1601))
* Fixed an issue where the map view while navigating in CarPlay showed labels in the style’s original language instead of the local language. ([#1601](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1601))
* Fixed an issue where rerouting could still occur after arrival, even though `NavigationServiceDelegate.navigationService(_:shouldPreventReroutesWhenArrivingAt:)` returned `true`. ([#1833](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1833))
* `NavigationMapViewDelegate.navigationMapView(_:routeStyleLayerWithIdentifier:source:)`, `NavigationMapViewDelegate.navigationMapView(_:routeCasingStyleLayerWithIdentifier:source:)`, `NavigationViewControllerDelegate.navigationViewController(_:routeStyleLayerWithIdentifier:source:)`, and `NavigationViewControllerDelegate.navigationViewController(_:routeCasingStyleLayerWithIdentifier:source:)` can now set the `MGLLineStyleLayer.lineGradient` property. ([#1799](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1799))
* Reduced the `NavigationMapView.minimumFramesPerSecond` property’s default value from 30 frames per second to 20 frames per second for improved performance on battery power. ([#1819](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1819))

## v0.23.0 (October 24, 2018)
* `CarPlayManager` is no longer a singleton; your application delegate is responsible for creating and owning an instance of this class. This fixes a crash in applications that specify the access token programmatically instead of in the Info.plist file. ([#1792](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1792))
* `NavigationService.start()` now sets the first coordinate on a route, if a fixed location isn't available the first few seconds of a navigation session. ([#1790](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1790))

## v0.22.3 (October 17, 2018)

* Fixed over-retain issue that resulted in the `MapboxNavigationService` persisting beyond its expected lifecycle. This could cause unexpected behavior with components that observe progress noitifications.
* Fixed warnings caused by internal usage of deprecated types.

## v0.22.2 (October 15, 2018)

* Fixed an issue where the U-turn icon in the turn banner pointed in the wrong direction. ([#1647](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1647))
* Fixed an issue where the user puck was positioned too close to the bottom of the map view, underlapping the current road name label. ([#1766](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1766))
* Added `InstructionsBannerView.showStepIndicator` to enable showing/hiding the drag indicator ([#1772](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1772))
* Renamed `EventsManager` to `NavigationEventsManager`. ([#1767](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1767))
* Added support in `NavigationEventsManager` that allows for routeless events. ([#1767](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1767))

## v0.22.1 (October 2, 2018)

### User Location

* Added ability to adjust `poorGPSPatience` of a `NavigationService`. [#1763](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1763)
* Increased default Poor-GPS patience of `MapboxNavigationService` to 2.5 seconds. [#1763](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1763)
* Fixed an issue where the map view while navigating in CarPlay displayed the day style even at night. ([#1762](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1762))

## v0.22.0 (October 1, 2018)

### Packaging

* Added a dependency on the Mapbox Navigation Native framework. If you use Carthage to install this framework, your target should also link against `MapboxNavigationNative.framework`. ([#1618](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1618))

### User location

* Added a `NavigationService` protocol implemented by classes that provide location awareness functionality. Our default implementation, `MapboxNavigationService` conforms to this protocol. ([#1602](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1602))
  * Added a new `Router` protocol, which allows for custom route-following logic. Our default implementation, `RouteController`, conforms to this protocol.
  * `NavigationViewController.init(for:styles:directions:styles:routeController:locationManager:voiceController:eventsManager)` has been renamed `NavigationViewController.init(for:styles:navigationService:voiceController:)`.
  * `NavigationViewController.routeController` has been replaced by `NavigationViewController.navigationService`.
  * If you currently use `RouteController` directly, you should migrate to `MapboxNavigationService`.
  * If you currently use `SimulatedLocationManager` directly, you should instead pass `SimulationOption.always` into `MapboxNavigationService(route:directions:locationSource:eventsManagerType:simulating:)`.
  * Note: the `MapboxNavigationService`, by default, will start simulating progress if more than 1.5 seconds elapses without any update from the GPS. This can happen when simulating locations in Xcode, or selecting the "Custom Location" simulation option in the iOS Simulator. This is normal behavior.
* Improved the reliability of off-route detection. ([#1618](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1618))

### User interface

* `StyleManagerDelegate.locationFor(styleManager:)` has been renamed to `StyleManagerDelegate.location(for:)`  ([#1724](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1724))
* Fixed inaccurate maneuver arrows along the route line when the route doubles back on itself. ([#1735](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1735))
* Added an `InstructionsBannerView.swipeable` property that allows the user to swipe the banner to the side to preview future steps. The `InstructionsBannerViewDelegate.didDragInstructionsBanner(_:)` method has been deprecated in favor of `InstructionsBannerViewDelegate.didSwipeInstructionsBanner(_:swipeDirection:)`. ([#1750](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1750))
* `NavigationMapView` no longer mutates its own frame rate implicitly. A new `NavigationMapView.updatePreferredFrameRate(for:)` method allows you to update the frame rate in response to route progress change notifications. The `NavigationMapView.minimumFramesPerSecond` property determines the frame rate while the application runs on battery power. By default, the map views in `NavigationViewController` and CarPlay’s navigation activity animate at a higher frame rate on battery power than before. ([#1749](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1749))
* Fixed a crash that occurred when the end of route view controller appears, showing the keyboard. ([#1754](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1754))

## v0.21.0 (September 17, 2018)

### User interface

* In CarPlay-enabled applications on iOS 12, this SDK now displays a map, search interface, and turn-by-turn navigation experience on the connected CarPlay device. The CarPlay screen is managed by the shared `CarPlayManager` object, which you can configure by implementing the `CarPlayManagerDelegate` protocol. ([#1714](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1714))
* Added the `Style.previewMapStyleURL` property for customizing the style displayed by a preview map. ([#1695](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1695))

### User location

* Breaking change: The `eventsManager` argument of `RouteController(along:directions:locationManager:eventsManager:)` is now required. `NavigationViewController(for:directions:styles:locationManager:voiceController:eventsManager:)` now has an optional `eventsManager` argument, which is passed to any instance of `RouteController` created as a result of rerouting. ([#1671](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1671))
* Fixed issues where the user puck would overshoot a turn or drift away from a curved road. ([#1710](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1710))
* Fixed incorrect conversions to inches in `DistanceFormatter`. ([#1699](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1699))
* Fixed several crashes related to telemetry collection. ([#1668](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1668))

## v0.20.1 (September 10, 2018)

* Upgraded mapbox-events-ios to v0.5.0 to avoid a potential incompatibility when using Carthage to install the SDK.
* Fixed a bug which prevented automatic day and night style switching. ([#1629](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1629))

## v0.20.0 (September 6, 2018)

### User interface

* While traveling on a numbered road, the route number is displayed in a shield beside the current road name at the bottom of the map. ([#1576](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1576))
* Added the `shouldManageApplicationIdleTimer` flag to `NavigationViewController` to allow applications to opt out of automatic `UIApplication.isIdleTimerDisabled` management. ([#1591](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1591))
* Added various methods, properties, and initializers to `StatusView`, allowing you to use it in a custom user interface. ([#1612](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1612))
* Added `StyleManager.automaticallyAdjustsStyleForTimeOfDay`, `StyleManager.delegate`, and `StyleManager.styles` properties so that you can control same time-based style switching just as `NavigationViewController` does. [#1617](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1617)
* Fixed an issue where the banner was stuck on rerouting past the reroute threshold when simulating navigation. ([#1583](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1583))
* Fixed an issue where the banner appears in the wrong colors after you tap the Resume button. ([#1588](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1588), [#1589](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1589))
* `NavigationMapView`’s user puck now responds to changes to the safe area insets while tracking the user’s location, matching the behavior of the map camera. ([#1653](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1653))
* Added `StepsViewControllerDelegate` and `InstructionsBannerViewDelegate` which makes it possible to listen in on tap events that occur in `StepsViewController` and `InstructionsBannerView`. [#1633](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1633)

### Feedback

* Added a `FeedbackViewController` class for soliciting feedback from the user in a custom user interface. ([#1605](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1605))
* Replaced `NavigationViewControllerDelegate.navigationViewControllerDidOpenFeedback(_:)` with `FeedbackViewControllerDelegate.feedbackViewControllerDidOpen(_:)`, `NavigationViewControllerDelegate.navigationViewControllerDidCancelFeedback(_:)` with `FeedbackViewControllerDelegate.feedbackViewController(_:didSend:uuid:)`, and `NavigationViewControllerDelegate.navigationViewController(_:didSendFeedbackAssigned:feedbackType)` with `FeedbackViewControllerDelegate.feedbackViewControllerDidCancel(_:)`. ([#1605](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1605))
* Fixed a crash that occurred when the end of route view controller appears, showing the keyboard. ([#1599](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1599/))

### Other changes

* Added a `MapboxVoiceController.audioPlayer` property. You can use this property to interrupt a spoken instruction or adjust the volume. ([#1596](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1596))
* Fixed a memory leak when `RouteController.isDeadReckoningEnabled` is enabled. ([#1624](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1624))

## v0.19.2 (August 23, 2018)

* The `MGLStyle.navigationGuidanceDayStyleURL` and `MGLStyle.navigationGuidanceNightStyleURL` properties now return [version 4 of the Mapbox Navigation Guidance Day and Night styles](https://blog.mapbox.com/incidents-are-live-on-the-map-beeff6b84bf9), respectively. These styles indicate incidents such as road closures and detours. ([#1619](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1619))
* Added an `MGLMapView.showsIncidents` property to toggle the visibility of any Mapbox Incidents data on a map view. ([#1613](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1613))

## v0.19.1 (August 15, 2018)

* Fixed build errors when installing this SDK with Mapbox Maps SDK for iOS v4.3.0 or above. ([#1608](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1608), [#1609](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1609))

## v0.19.0 (July 24, 2018)

### Packaging

* Moved guides and examples to [a new Mapbox Navigation SDK for iOS website](https://docs.mapbox.com/ios/navigation/). ([#1552](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1552))
* Applications intended for use in mainland China can set the `MGLMapboxAPIBaseURL` key in Info.plist to `https://api.mapbox.cn/` to use China-optimized APIs. This setting causes `NavigationMapView` to default to China-optimized day and night styles with places and roads labeled in Simplified Chinese. ([#1558](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1558))

### User interface

* Fixed an issue where selecting a step from the steps list would take the user to the wrong step. ([#1524](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1524/))
* The `StyleManagerDelegate.locationFor(styleManager:)` method’s return value is now optional. ([#1523](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1523))
* `NavigationViewController` smoothly fades between light and dark status bars. ([#1535](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1535))
* Renamed the `InstructionsBannerView.updateInstruction(_:)` method to `InstructionsBannerView.update(for:)`. Added the `NextBannerView.update(for:)` and `LanesView.update(for:)` methods. These methods are intended to be called in response to `Notification.Name.routeControllerDidPassVisualInstructionPoint` if the views are used outside a `NavigationViewController`. By contrast, `InstructionsBannerView.updateDistance(for:)` should be called on every location update. ([#1514](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1514))
* Added the `ManeuverView.visualInstruction` and `ManeuverView.drivingSide` properties. ([#1514](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1514))

## v0.18.1 (June 19, 2018)

### Packaging

* Increased the minimum deployment target of Core Navigation to iOS 9. ([#1494](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1494))

### User interface

* Added `NavigationMapView.recenterMap()` for recentering the map if a user gesture causes it to stop following the user. ([#1471](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1471))
* Deprecated `NavigationViewController.usesNightStyleInsideTunnels`. Style switching is enabled as a side effect of `TunnelIntersectionManager.tunnelSimulationEnabled`, which is set to `true` by default. ([#1489]
* Fixed an issue where the user location view slid around after the user pressed the Overview button. [#1506](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1506)

### Core Navigation

* Moved `RouteController.tunnelSimulationEnabled` to `TunnelIntersectionManager.tunnelSimulationEnabled`. ([#1489](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1489))
(https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1489))
* Added `RouteControllerDelegate.routeControllerWillDisableBatteryMonitoring(_:)` which allows developers control whether battery monitoring is disabled when `RouteController.deinit()` is called. [#1476](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1476)
* Fixed an issue where setting `NavigationLocationManager.desiredAccuracy` had no effect. [#1481](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1481)

## v0.18.0 (June 5, 2018)

### User interface

* Added support for generic route shields. Image-backed route shields also now display as generic (instead of plain text) while the SDK loads the image. [#1190](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/issues/1190), [#1417](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1417)
* Fixed an issue when going into overhead mode with a short route. [#1456](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1456/)
* Adds support for Xcode 10 Beta 1. [#1499](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1499), [#1478](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1478)

### Core Navigation

* `TunnelIntersectionManagerDelegate` methods no longer take a completion handler argument. ([#1414](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1414))
* Added the ability to render more than 1 alternate route. [#1372](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1372/)
* `NavigationMapViewDelegate.navigationMapView(_:shapeFor:)` Now expects an array of `Route`. The first route will be rendered as the main route, all subsequent routes will be rendered as alternate routes.
* Animating the user through tunnels and automatically switching the map style when entering a tunnel is now on by default. [#1449](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1449)
* Adds `RouteControllerDelegate.routeController(_:shouldPreventReroutesWhenArrivingAt:waypoint:)` which is called each time a driver arrives at a waypoint. By default, this method returns true and prevents rerouting upon arriving. Progress updates still occur. [#1454](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1454/)

## v0.17.0 (May 14, 2018)

### Packaging

* Upgraded to the [Mapbox Maps SDK for iOS v4.0.0](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/releases/tag/ios-v4.0.0). If you have customized the route map’s appearance, you may need to migrate your code to use expressions instead of style functions. ([#1076](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1076))
* Added a Korean localization. ([#1346](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1346))

### User interface

* Exit indications are now drawn accurately with a correct exit heading. ([#1288](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1288))
* Added the `NavigationViewControllerDelegate.navigationViewController(_:roadNameAt:)` method for customizing the contents of the road name label that appears towards the bottom of the map view. ([#1309](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1309))
* If the SDK tries but fails to reroute the user, the “Rerouting…” status view no longer stays visible permanently. ([#1357](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1357))
* Completed waypoints now remain on the map but are slightly translucent. ([#1364](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1364))
* Fixed an issue preventing `NavigationViewController.navigationMapView(_:simplifiedShapeDescribing:)` (now `NavigationViewController.navigationMapView(_:simplifiedShapeFor:)`) from being called. ([#1413](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1413))

### Spoken instructions

* Fixed an issue causing the wrong instructions to be spoken. ([#1396](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1396))

### User location

* The `RouteController.routeProgress` property is now available in Objective-C. ([#1323](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1323))
* Added a `RouteController.tunnelSimulationEnabled` option that keeps the user location indicator moving steadily while the user travels through a tunnel and GPS reception is unreliable. ([#1218](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1218))

### Other changes

* `DistanceFormatter`, `ReplayLocationManager`, `SimulatedLocationManager`, `LanesView`, and `ManueverView` are now subclassable. ([#1345](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1345))
* Renamed many `NavigationViewController` and `NavigationMapViewDelegate` methods ([#1364](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1364), [#1338](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1338), [#1318](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1318), [#1378](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1378), [#1413](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1413)):
    * `NavigationViewControllerDelegate.navigationViewControllerDidCancelNavigation(_:)` to `NavigationViewControllerDelegate.navigationViewControllerDidDismiss(_:byCanceling:)`
    * `-[MBNavigationViewControllerDelegate navigationViewController:didArriveAt:]` to `-[MBNavigationViewControllerDelegate navigationViewController:didArriveAtWaypoint:]` in Objective-C
    * `NavigationViewControllerDelegate.navigationMapView(_:routeStyleLayerWithIdentifier:source:)` to `NavigationViewControllerDelegate.navigationViewController(_:routeStyleLayerWithIdentifier:source:)`
    * `NavigationViewControllerDelegate.navigationMapView(_:routeCasingStyleLayerWithIdentifier:source:)` to `NavigationViewControllerDelegate.navigationViewController(_:routeCasingStyleLayerWithIdentifier:source:)`
    * `NavigationViewControllerDelegate.navigationMapView(_:shapeFor:)` to `NavigationViewControllerDelegate.navigationViewController(_:shapeFor:)`
    * `NavigationViewControllerDelegate.navigationMapView(_:simplifiedShapeFor:)` to `NavigationViewControllerDelegate.navigationViewController(_:simplifiedShapeFor:)`
    * `NavigationViewControllerDelegate.navigationMapView(_:waypointStyleLayerWithIdentifier:source:)` to `NavigationViewControllerDelegate.navigationViewController(_:waypointStyleLayerWithIdentifier:source:)`
    * `NavigationViewControllerDelegate.navigationMapView(_:waypointSymbolStyleLayerWithIdentifier:source:)` to `NavigationViewControllerDelegate.navigationViewController(_:waypointSymbolStyleLayerWithIdentifier:source:)`
    * `NavigationViewControllerDelegate.navigationMapView(_:shapeFor:legIndex:)` to `NavigationViewControllerDelegate.navigationViewController(_:shapeFor:legIndex:)`
    * `NavigationViewControllerDelegate.navigationMapView(_:didTap:)` to `NavigationViewControllerDelegate.navigationViewController(_:didSelect:)`
    * `NavigationViewControllerDelegate.navigationMapView(_:imageFor:)` to `NavigationViewControllerDelegate.navigationViewController(_:imageFor:)`

    * `NavigationViewControllerDelegate.navigationViewController(_:didSend:feedbackType:)` to `NavigationViewControllerDelegate.navigationViewController(_:didSendFeedbackAssigned:feedbackType:)`
    * `-[MBNavigationViewControllerDelegate navigationViewController:shouldDiscard:]` to `-[MBNavigationViewControllerDelegate navigationViewController:shouldDiscardLocation:]` in Objective-C
    * `-[MBNavigationViewControllerDelegate navigationViewController:roadNameAt:]` to `-[MBNavigationViewControllerDelegate navigationViewController:roadNameAtLocation:]`
    * `NavigationMapViewDelegate.navigationMapView(_:shapeDescribing:)` to `NavigationMapViewDelegate.navigationMapView(_:shapeFor:)`.
    * `NavigationMapViewDelegate.navigationMapView(_:simplifiedShapeDescribing:)` to `NavigationMapViewDelegate.navigationMapView(_:simplifiedShapeFor:)`.
    * `-[MBNavigationMapViewDelegate navigationMapView:shapeDescribingWaypoints:legIndex:]` to `-[MBNavigationMapViewDelegate navigationMapView:shapeForWaypoints:legIndex:]` in Objective-C
* `RouteController.recordFeedback(type:description:)` now returns a `UUID` instead of a string. Some `RouteController` methods have been renamed to accept `UUID`s as arguments instead of strings. ([#1413](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1413))
* Renamed `TunnelIntersectionManagerDelegate.tunnelIntersectionManager(_:willEnableAnimationAt:callback:)` to `TunnelIntersectionManagerDelegate.tunnelIntersectionManager(_:willEnableAnimationAt:completionHandler:)` and `TunnelIntersectionManagerDelegate.tunnelIntersectionManager(_:willDisableAnimationAt:callback:)` to `TunnelIntersectionManagerDelegate.tunnelIntersectionManager(_:willDisableAnimationAt:completionHandler:)`. ([#1413](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1413))

## v0.16.0 (March 26, 2018)

### User interface
* While the user travels through a tunnel, `NavigationMapView` temporarily applies a night style (a style whose `styleType` property is set to `StyleType.night`). ([#1127](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1127))
* The user can reveal the list of upcoming steps by swiping downward from the top banner. ([#1150](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1150))
* Renamed `StyleType.dayStyle` and `StyleType.nightStyle` to `StyleType.day` and `StyleType.night`, respectively. ([#1250](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1250))
* Fixed an issue causing the overview map to insist on centering the route upon each location update. ([#1223](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1223))

* Adds a handle at the bottom of the banner to reveals additional instructions. ([#1253](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1253))

### Spoken instructions
* Audio data for spoken instructions is cached in device storage to minimize data usage. ([#12296](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1226))

### Core Navigation
* Renamed the `RouteController.reroutesOpportunistically` property to `RouteController.reroutesProactively`, `RouteControllerOpportunisticReroutingInterval` global variable to `RouteControllerProactiveReroutingInterval`, and the `RouteControllerNotificationUserInfoKey.isOpportunisticKey` value to `RouteControllerNotificationUserInfoKey.isProactiveKey`. ([#1230](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1230))
* Added a `RouteStepProgress.currentIntersection` property that is set to the intersection the user has most recently passed along the route. ([#1127](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1127))

* The Constants that concern Route-Snapping logic have been re-named. The new names are: `RouteSnappingMinimumSpeed`, `RouteSnappingMaxManipulatedCourseAngle`, and `RouteSnappingMinimumHorizontalAccuracy`.

#### User interface
* `StepsViewController` 's convenience initializer (`StepsViewController.init(routeProgress:)`) is now public. ([#1167](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1167))
* Fixed an issue preventing the distance from appearing in the turn banner when the system language was set to Hebrew and the system region was set to Israel or any other region that uses the metric system. ([#1176](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1176))
* Various views and view controllers correctly mirror right-to-left in Hebrew. ([#1182](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1182))

#### Core Navigation
* `RoteController` now has a new property, `snappedLocation`. This property represents the raw location, snapped to the current route, if applicable. If not applicable, the value is `nil`.
* `RouteController`'s `MBRouteControllerProgressDidChange` notification now exposes the raw location in it's update, accessible by `MBRouteControllerRawLocationKey`

#### Voice guidance

* Fixed an issue that caused `RouteVoiceController` and `MabpboxVoiceController` to speak over one another. [#1213](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1213)

#### Other changes
* Fixed a crash while navigating that affected applications that do not use Mapbox-hosted styles or vector tiles. [#1183](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1183)
* The `DistanceFormatter.attributedString(for:)` method is now implemented. It returns an attributed string representation of the distance in which the `NSAttributedStringKey.quantity` attribute is applied to the numeric quantity. ([#1176](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1176))
* Fixed an issue in which turn lanes were displayed in the wrong order when the system language was set to Hebrew. ([#1175](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1175))

## v0.14.0 (February 22, 2018)

#### Breaking changes

* Removed the dependency on AWSPolly. Voice announcements are now coming directly from Mapbox and for free for all developers. Because of this, PollyVoiceController has been removed.  [#617](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/617)
* MapboxDirections.swift version 0.17.x is now required. [#1085](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1085)
* Removed the key `RouteControllerNotificationUserInfoKey.estimatedTimeUntilManeuverKey` from `.routeControllerProgressDidChange`. Please use `durationRemaining` instead which can be found on the `RouteProgress`. [#1126](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1126/)
* Renamed notification names associated with `RouteController` in Objective-C code. [#1122](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1122)
* The user info keys of `RouteController`-related notifications have been renamed and are now members of the `RouteControllerNotificationUserInfoKey` struct in Swift and the `MBRouteControllerNotificationUserInfoKey` extensible enumeration in Objective-C. [#1122](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1122)

## Core Navigation

* Location updates sent via `.routeControllerProgressDidChange` are now always sent as long as the location is qualified. [#1126](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1126/)
* Exposes `setOverheadCameraView(from:along:for:)` which is useful for fitting the camera to an overhead view for the remaining route coordinates.
* Changed the heuristics needed for a the users location to unsnap from the route line. [#1110](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1122)
* Changes `routeController(:didDiscardLocation:)` to `routeController(:shouldDiscardLocation:)`. Now if implemented, developers can choose to keep a location when RouteController deems a location unqualified. [#1095](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1095/)

## User interface

* Added a `NavigationMapView.localizeLabels()` method that should be called within `MGLMapViewDelegate.mapView(_:didFinishLoading:)` for standalone `NavigationMapView`s to ensure that map labels are in the correct language. [#1111](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1122)
* The `/` delimiter is longer shown when a shield is shown on either side of the delimiter. This also removes the dependency SDWebImage. [#1046](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1046)
* Exposes constants used for styling the route line. [#1124](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1124/)
* Exposes `update(for:)` on `InstructionBannerView`. This is helpful for developers creating a custom user interface. [#1085](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1085/)

## Voice guidance

* Exposes `RouteVoiceController.speak(_:)` which would allow custom subclass of MapboxVoiceController to override this method and pass a modified SpokenInstruction to our superclass implementation.

## v0.13.1 (February 7, 2018)

### Core Navigation

* Fixes a bug where the `spokenInstructionIndex` was incremented beyond the number of instructions for a step. (#1080)
* Fixed a bug that crashed when navigating beyond the final waypoint. (#1087)
* Added `NavigationSettings.distanceUnit` to let a user override the default unit of measurement for the device’s region setting. (#1055)

### User interface

* Added support for spoken instructions in Danish. (#1041)
* Updated translations for Russian, Swedish, Spanish, Vietnamese, Hebrew, Ukrainian, and German. (#1064)
* Fixed a bug that prevented the user puck from laying flat when rotating the map. (#1090)
* Updated translations for Russian, Swedish, Spanish, Vietnamese, Hebrew, Ukrainian, and German. (#1064) (#1089)

## v0.13.0 (January 22, 2018)

### Packaging

* Upgraded to MapboxDirections.swift [v0.16.0](https://github.com/mapbox/MapboxDirections.swift/releases/tag/v0.16.0), which makes `ManeuverType`, `ManeuverDirection`, and `TransportType` non-optional. (#1040)
* Added Danish and Hebrew localizations. (#1031, #1043)

### User location

* Removed `RouteControllerDelegate.routeController(_:shouldIncrementLegWhenArrivingAtWaypoint:)` and `NavigationViewControllerDelegate.navigationViewController(_:shouldIncrementLegWhenArrivingAtWaypoint:)`. `RouteControllerDelegate.routeController(_:didArriveAt:)` and `NavigationViewControllerDelegate.navigationViewController(_:didArriveAt:)` now return a Boolean that determines whether the route controller automatically advances to the next leg of the route. (#1038)
* Fixed an issue where `NavigationViewControllerDelegate.navigationViewController(_:didArriveAt:)` was called twice at the end of the route. (#1038)
* Improved the reliability of user location tracking when several location updates arrive simultaneously. (#1021)

### User interface

* Removed the `WayNameView` class in favor of `WayNameLabel` and renamed the `LanesContainerView` class to `LanesView`. (#981 )
* Added a `NavigationMapView.tracksUserCourse` property for enabling course tracking mode when using the map view independently of `NavigationViewController`. (#1015)

## v0.12.2 (January 12, 2018)

Beginning with this release, we’ve compiled [a set of examples](https://docs.mapbox.com/ios/api/navigation/0.12.2/Examples.html) showing how to accomplish common tasks with this SDK. You can also check out the [navigation-ios-examples](https://github.com/mapbox/navigation-ios-examples) project and run the included application on your device.

### User interface

* Fixed a crash loading `NavigationViewController`. (#977)
* Fixed issues causing the user puck to animate at the wrong framerate while the device is unplugged. (#970)
* Fixed unexpected behavior that occurred if only one `Style` was specified when initializing `NavigationViewController`. (#990)

### Core Navigation

* If `RouteController` initially follows an alternative route, it now attempts to follow the most similar route after rerouting. (#995)
* Fixed an issue preventing the `RouteControllerDelegate.routeController(_:didArriveAt:)` method from being called if `navigationViewController(_:shouldIncrementLegWhenArrivingAtWaypoint:)` was unimplemented. (#984)
* Added a `VoiceControllerDelegate.voiceController(_:willSpeak:routeProgress:)` method for changing spoken instructions on an individual basis. (#988)

## v0.12.1 (January 6, 2018)

### User interface

* Fixed an issue where the “then” banner appeared at the wrong times. (#957)
* Fixed an issue where the user location view spun around at the end of a leg. (#966)

### Core Navigation

* Fixed an issue that triggered unnecessary reroutes. (#959)
* The `RouteControllerDelegate.routeController(_:didArriveAt:)` method is now called when arriving at any waypoint, not just the last waypoint. (#972)
* Added a `RouteController.setEndOfRoute(_:comment:)` method for collecting feedback about the route before the user cancels it. (#965)

## v0.12.0 (December 21, 2017)

### Breaking changes 🚨

* If you install this SDK using Carthage, you must now include each of this SDK’s dependencies in your Run Script build phase: AWSCore.framework, AWSPolly.framework, Mapbox.framework, MapboxDirections.framework, MapboxMobileEvents.framework, Polyline.framework, SDWebImage.framework, Solar.framework, and Turf.framework. These dependencies are no longer embedded inside MapboxNavigation.framework. See [the Carthage documentation](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage#if-youre-building-for-ios-tvos-or-watchos) for details. (#930)
* This library no longer depends on [OSRM Text Instructions for Swift](https://github.com/Project-OSRM/osrm-text-instructions.swift/). If you have previously installed this SDK using Carthage, you may need to remove OSRMTextInstructions.framework from a Run Script build step. (#925)
* Notification names are now members of `Notification.Name`. (#943)

### User interface

* When the user approaches the final waypoint, a panel appears with options for sending feedback about the route. (#848)
* Fixed an issue preventing the “Then” banner from appearing. (#940)
* Fixed an issue that sometimes prevented the night style from being applied. (#904)
* The turn banner’s labels and route shield images are now derived from the Directions API response. (#767)
* Roundabout icons in the turn banner now go clockwise in regions that drive on the left. (#911)
* Fixed an issue that turned the estimated arrival time to black when traffic congestion data was unavailable. (#912)
* Added a Bulgarian localization. [Help us speak your language!](https://www.transifex.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/) (#954)
* Updated Dutch, Spanish, Swedish, and Vietnamese translations. (#944)

### Voice guidance

* Tapping the mute button immediately silences any current announcement. (#936)
* Improved announcements near roundabouts and rotaries when using `NavigationRouteOptions`. You can also set the `RouteOptions.includesExitRoundaboutManeuver` property manually to take advantage of this improvement. (#945)
* You can customize the AWS region used for Amazon Polly spoken instructions using the `PollyVoiceController(identityPoolId:regionType:)` initializer. (#914)
* Certain roads [tagged with pronunciations in OpenStreetMap](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:name:pronunciation) are pronounced correctly when Amazon Polly is unavailable. (#624)
* Refined the appearance of the spoken instruction map labels that are enabled via the `NavigationViewController.annotatesSpokenInstructions` property. (#907)

### User location

* When `SimulatedLocationManager` is active, the user can swipe on the “Simulating Navigation” banner to adjust the rate of travel. (#915)
* Fixed unnecessary rerouting that sometimes occurred if the user advanced to a subsequent step earlier than expected. (#910)
* If your application’s Info.plist file lacks a location usage description, `NavigationViewController` will immediately fail a `precondition`. (#947)

## v0.11.0 (November 29, 2017)

Beginning with this release, the navigation SDK and Core Navigation are written in Swift 4 (#663).

### Feedback

* Removed the audio feedback recording feature. You no longer need to add an `NSMicrophoneUsageDescription` to your Info.plist. (#870)
* The Report Feedback button no longer appears after rerouting if `NavigationViewController.showsReportFeedback` is disabled. (#890)

### User interface

* Added a `StepsViewController` class for displaying the route’s upcoming steps in a table view. (#869)
* The bottom bar is more compact in landscape orientation. (#863)
* Fixed an issue where the “then” banner appeared too soon. (#865)
* Maneuver arrows are no longer shown for arrival maneuvers. (#884)
* Fixed a crash that sometimes occurred after returning to the application from the background. (#888)

### Voice guidance

* A new `RouteVoiceController.voiceControllerDelegate` property lets an object conforming to the `VoiceControllerDelegate` protocol know when a spoken instruction fails or gets interrupted by another instruction. (#800, #864)

### User location

* Fixed an issue that sometimes prevented `NavigationViewControllerDelegate.navigationViewController(_:didArriveAt:)` from getting called. (#883)
* Fixed an issue where the user location indicator floated around when starting a new leg. (#886)

## v0.10.1 (November 16, 2017)

### Packaging

* Reverts a change that used AWS's repo for the Polly dependency. This will help with build times when using Carthage. #859
* Updates Polly dependency to v2.6.5 #859

### Views

* Aligns the instruction banner and the next banner better. #860
* Fixes a bug on `InstructionsBannerView` and `StepInstructionsView` that prevented them from being styleable. #852
* Fixes a few minor styleable elements on `DayStyle` and `NightStyle`. #858

### Map

* `MGLMapView init(frame:styleURL:)` is exposed again on `NavigationMapView`. #850

### User location tracking

* The refresh rate of the user puck remains throttled if the upcoming step is straight. #845

### Feedback

* The `Report Feedback` button after rerouting is only displayed for 5 seconds. #853

## v0.10.0 (November 13, 2017)

### Packaging

* Xcode 9 is required for building the navigation SDK or Core Navigation. (#786)
* Added German and Dutch localizations. [Help us speak your language!](https://www.transifex.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/dashboard/) (#778)
* To build and run the provided sample applications, you now have the option to create a plain text file named .mapbox containing a Mapbox access token and place it in your home folder. The SDK will read this file and automatically populate the `MGLMapboxAccessToken` of the `Info.plist` at build-time. (#817)

### Instruction banner

* Improved `NavigationViewController`’s layout on iPhone X. (#786, #816)
* Refined the turn banner’s appearance. (#745, #788)
* Added a reusable `InstructionBannerView` class that represents the turn banner. (#745)
* Route shields are displayed inline with road or place names in `InstructionBannerView`. (#745)
* When another step follows soon after the upcoming step, that subsequent step appears in a smaller banner beneath the main turn banner. (#819)

### Map

* The map zooms in and out dynamically to show more of the road ahead. (#769, #781)
* Replaced `NavigationMapView.showRoute(_:)` with `NavigationMapView.showRoutes(_:legIndex:)`, which can show alternative routes on the map. (#789)
* Added a `NavigationMapViewDelegate.navigationMapView(_:didSelect:)` method to respond to route selection on the map. (#789, #806)
* Added a `NavigationMapViewDelegate.navigationMapView(_:didSelect:)` method to respond to waypoint selection on the map. (#806)
* Fixed a bug preventing legs beyond the third waypoint from appearing. (#807)
* Decreased the map’s animation frame rate for improved battery life. (#760)

### Voice guidance

* Spoken instructions are determined by Directions API responses. (#614)
* When Polly is enabled, audio for spoken instructions is fetched over the network ahead of time, reducing latency. (#724, #768)
* The `NavigationViewController.annotatesSpokenInstructions` property, disabled by default, makes it easier to see where instructions will be read aloud along the route for debugging purposes. (#727, #826)
* Fixed an issue preventing `PollyVoiceController` from ducking background audio while the device is muted using the physical switch. (#805)

### User location tracking

* Fixed an issue causing poor user location tracking on iPhone X. (#833)
* The user location indicator is more stable while snapped to the route line. (#754)
* Renamed `RouteController.checkForFasterRouteInBackground` to `RouteController.reroutesOpportunistically`. (#826)
* Added a `RouteControllerOpportunisticReroutingInterval` constant for configuring the interval between opportunistic rerouting attempts. (#826)

### Feedback

* The `NavigationViewController.recordsAudioFeedback` property, disabled by default, allows the user to dictate feedback by long-pressing on a feedback item. This option requires the `NSMicrophoneUsageDescription` Info.plist option. (#719, #826)
* Options in the feedback interface are easier to discern from each other. (#761)
* Fixed an issue where the feedback interface appeared automatically after rerouting. (#749)
* Rearranged the feedback options. (#770, #779)

## v0.9.0 (October 17, 2017)

* `NavigationMapView` uses a custom course tracking mode created from the ground up. The view representing the user’s location (the “user puck”) is larger and easier to see at a glance, and it continues to point in the user’s direction of travel even in Overview mode. To customize the user puck, use the `NavigationMapView.userCourseView` property. (#402)
* Fixed an issue causing the user puck to slide downward from the center of the screen when beginning a new route. (#402)
* You can customize the user puck’s location on screen by implementing the `NavigationViewControllerDelegate.navigationViewController(_:mapViewUserAnchorPoint:)` method. (#402)
* Improved user course snapping while not moving. (#718)
* Throttled the map’s frame rate while the device is unplugged. (#709)
* Fixed an issue causing the “Rerouting” banner to persist even after a new route is received. (#707)
* A local user notification is no longer posted when rerouting. (#708)

## v0.8.3 (October 9, 2017)

* Pins the dependency `Solar` to v2.0.0. This should fix some build issues. #693
* Increases the width of the upcoming maneuver arrow. #671
* Improved user location snapping. #679
* Improves simulation mode by using more accurate speeds. #683
* Adopted [Turf](https://github.com/mapbox/turf-swift). The `wrap(_:min:max:)` function has been removed; use Turf’s `CLLocationDirection.wrap(min:max:)` instead. #653
* Defaulted to `kCLLocationAccuracyBestForNavigation` for location accuracy. #670

## v0.8.2 (September 29, 2017)

* Fixed a bug which caused the upcoming maneuver label in night mode to have a white background (#667).
* Fixed a bug which caused audio announcements to be repeated over one another (#661,  #669).

## v0.8.1 (September 28, 2017)

* Fixed a build error that occurred if MapboxNavigation was installed via CocoaPods. (#632)
* The turn banner shows more of the upcoming road name before truncating. (#657)
* When entering a roundabout, the icon in the turn banner indicates the correct direction of travel. (#640)
* When beginning a new route, the SDK announces the initial road and direction of travel. (#654)
* Fixed an issue causing the user’s location to be snapped to the wrong part of the route near a U-turn. (#642)
* Core Navigation detects when the user performs a U-turn earlier than anticipated and promptly calculates a new route. (#646)
* If Amazon Polly is configured but unreachable, the SDK switches to AVSpeechSynthesizer sooner, before the instruction becomes outdated. (#652)
* When instructions are announced by Amazon Polly, [dynamic range compression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_range_compression) is used to make the audio easier to hear over the din of a moving vehicle. (#635, #662)

## v0.8.0 (September 19, 2017)

### Location and guidance

* Fixed an issue causing steps to be linked together too frequently. (#573)
* On a freeway, an announcement is read aloud at ¼ mile ahead of a maneuver instead of ½ mile ahead. (#569)
* Separate instructions are given for entering and exiting a roundabout. (#561)
* Rerouting occurs more promptly when the user makes a wrong turn at an intersection. (#560)
* More unreliable location updates are filtered out. (#579)
* Improved how Polly pronounces some road names and numbers. (#618, #622)
* Instructions are read by the higher-quality [Alex](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT203077) voice if it is installed and Polly is unconfigured or unavailable. (#612)

### User interface

* Adjusted the night style to take effect closer to sunset. (#584)
* Fixed an issue where the map bore a day style while the surrounding UI bore a night style. (#572)
* Fixed an issue causing some elements on the map to disappear when switching styles. (#570)
* Fixed an issue causing slight turns to look like regular turns in the turn banner. (#602)

* A tone is played when automatically switching to a faster route in the background. (#541)
* Polly now pronounces Italian instructions using an Italian voice. (#542)
* Fixed an issue preventing the SDK from falling back to AVFoundation when Polly is unavailable. (#544)
* Improved the wording of various instructions in Swedish. (Project-OSRM/osrm-text-instructions#138)
* The Spanish localization consistently uses _usted_ form. (Project-OSRM/osrm-text-instructions#137)
