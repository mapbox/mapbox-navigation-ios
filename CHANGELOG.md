# Changes to the Mapbox Navigation SDK for iOS

## v1.0.0

### Packaging

* Carthage v0.35 or above is now required for installing this SDK if you use Carthage. ([`81a36d0`](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/commit/81a36d090e8a0602b7144ee7697b7857675b496f)) 
* For the time being, MapboxCoreNavigation.framework depends on a build of MapboxNavigationNative.framework that is only available to authorized beta testers. Please contact your Mapbox sales representative or [support team](https://support.mapbox.com/) to learn more about the beta testing program. ([#2412](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2412))
* MapboxNavigation depends on Mapbox Maps SDK for iOS v6.0.0. Before CocoaPods or Carthage can download Mapbox.framework, you need to create a special-purpose access token. See [the updated installation instructions in the readme](./README.md#installing-the-latest-prerelease) for more details. ([#2437](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2437)) 
* Xcode 11.4.1 or above is now required for building this SDK from source. ([#2417](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2417))
* Enabled MAU billing by default, so that SDKs usage of Mapbox APIs is [billed](https://www.mapbox.com/pricing/) together based on [monthly active users](https://docs.mapbox.com/help/glossary/monthly-active-users/) rather than individually by HTTP request. If you prefer to still use request-based billing, set the `MBXNavigationBillingMethod` key in Info.plist to `request` ([#2405](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2405).
* Added Greek and Turkish localizations. ([#2385](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2385), [#2475](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2475))

### User location

* Fixed an issue where various delegate methods omitted `CLLocation.courseAccuracy` and `CLLocation.speedAccuracy` properties from passed-in `CLLocation` objects when using `RouteController`, even when these properties are provided by Core Location on iOS 13.4 and above. ([#2417](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2417))
* Fixed issues where the user puck would sometimes drift away from the route line even though the user was following the route. ([#2412](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2412), [#2417](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2417))
* Fixed an issue where `RouteController` took longer than usual to detect that the user had gone off-route. ([#2412](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2412))
* Fixed an issue where `RouteController` would detect that the user had gone off-route due to a single errant location update. ([#2412](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2412), [#2417](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2417))
* Fixed an issue where the camera and user puck would cut a corner when making a turn at speed. ([#2412](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2412))
* Fixed an issue where `RouteController` became too sensitive to the user going off-route near “intersections” that the Mapbox Directions API synthesizes at road classification changes, such as at either end of a tunnel. ([#2412](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2412))
* If the user’s raw course as reported by Core Location differs significantly from the direction of the road ahead, the camera and user puck are oriented according to the raw course. ([#2417](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2417))
* `RouteController` now tracks the user’s location more accurately within roundabouts. ([#2417](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2417))
* Fixed an issue where departure instructions were briefly missing when beginning turn-by-turn navigation. ([#2417](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2417))

### User location

* Improved the accuracy of location tracking and off-route detection. ([#2319](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2319))
* Fixed an issue where location tracking would pause at the beginning of a route after setting `RouteOptions.shapeFormat` to `RouteShapeFormat.polyline` or `RouteShapeFormat.geoJSON`. Note that you most likely do not need to override the default value of `RouteShapeFormat.polyline6`: this is the least bandwidth-intensive format, and `Route.shape` and `RouteStep.shape` are set to `LineString`s regardless. ([#2319](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2319))

### Offline navigation

* Fixed a crash that occurred after setting `RouteOptions.shapeFormat` to `RouteShapeFormat.geoJSON`. ([valhalla/valhalla#1867](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/pull/1867))
* Fixed an issue where some routes had unreasonably long expected travel times. ([valhalla/valhalla#2102](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/pull/2102))
* Fixed incorrect routing at some intersections of divided roads where there are turn restrictions. ([valhalla/valhalla#2109](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/pull/2109))
* Fixed issues where routes would sometimes require divebombing. ([valhalla/valhalla#1931](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/pull/1931))
* Fixed an issue where the route would sometimes contain duplicate waypoints. ([valhalla/valhalla#1880](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/pull/1880))
* Fixed an issue where an exception to a road closure on a public holiday was being ignored. ([valhalla/valhalla#2198](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/pull/2198))
* By default, calculated routes follow alleys less often. ([valhalla/valhalla#2231](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/pull/2231))
* When `RouteOptions.profileIdentifier` is set to `DirectionsProfileIdentifier.cycling`, the calculated route may now follow paths tagged with [mountain biking difficulty levels](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:mtb:scale) in OpenStreetMap. ([valhalla/valhalla#2117](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/pull/2117))
* Fixed an issue where floating-point numbers in tags were parsed incorrectly. ([valhalla/valhalla#2355](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/pull/2355))
* When two maneuvers are spaced close together, the spoken instruction now describes both maneuvers. ([valhalla/valhalla#2353](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/pull/2353))
* Turn lane indications are now shown below the turn banner as when navigating online. ([valhalla/valhalla#1830](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/pull/1830), [valhalla/valhalla#1859](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/pull/1859))
* Fixed an issue where the `RouteStep.expectedTravelTime` properties of each step did not add up to the `RouteLeg.expectedTravelTime` property. ([valhalla/valhalla#2195](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/pull/2195))
* Fixed an issue where a forward- or backward-only speed limit was not considered when calculating some expected travel times. ([valhalla/valhalla#2198](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/pull/2198))
* Suppressed extraneous `ManeuverType.reachFork` maneuvers. ([valhalla/valhalla#1886](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/pull/1886), [valhalla/valhalla#1909](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/pull/1909), [valhalla/valhalla#1928](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/pull/1928))
* A spoken instruction about a `ManeuverType.merge` maneuver now indicates whether to merge to the left or the right, as when navigating online. ([valhalla/valhalla#1892](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/pull/1892), [valhalla/valhalla#1989](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/pull/1989))
* Spoken instructions for `ManeuverType.exitRoundabout` and `ManeuverType.exitRotary` maneuvers now indicate the outlet road name or destination if available. ([valhalla/valhalla#2378](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/pull/2378))
* Fixed ungrammatical spoken instructions at sharp turns in English. ([valhalla/valhalla#2226](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/pull/2226))
* Fixed an issue where spoken and visual instructions sometimes omitted the cardinal direction after a route number in the United States. ([valhalla/valhalla#1917](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/pull/1917))
* A spoken instruction about a `ManeuverType.takeOffRamp` maneuver no longer specifies the side of the road if the ramp branches off the slow lane (on the right side in regions that drive on the right). ([valhalla/valhalla#1990](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/pull/1990))
* Improved the timing of spoken instructions for `ManeuverType.takeOffRamp` maneuvers along high-speed roads. ([#2417](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2417))
* Improved the timing of visual instructions when two maneuvers are spaced close together. ([#2417](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2417))

### Feedback
* Updated `FeedbackType` enum to reflect new top level feedback categories and introduced new `FeedbackSubType`s to support a more granular feedback mechanism. ([#2419](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2419))
* Updated image icons for top-level feedback collection view items. ([#2419](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2419), [#2421](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2421))
* The feedback screen no longer dismisses automatically after 10 seconds. ([#2420](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2420))

### Other changes

* Removed `NavigationMapViewDelegate.navigationMapView(_:routeStyleLayerWithIdentifier:source:)`, `NavigationMapViewDelegate.navigationMapView(_:routeCasingStyleLayerWithIdentifier:source:)` in favor of four new delegate methods to customize the route styling ([#2377](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2377)):
  * `NavigationMapViewDelegate.navigationMapView(_:mainRouteStyleLayerWithIdentifier:source:)` to style the main route.
  * `NavigationMapViewDelegate.navigationMapView(_:mainRouteCasingStyleLayerWithIdentifier:source:)` to style the casing of the main route.
  * `NavigationMapViewDelegate.navigationMapView(_:alternativeRouteStyleLayerWithIdentifier:source:)` to style alternative routes.
  * `NavigationMapViewDelegate.navigationMapView(_:alternativeRouteCasingStyleLayerWithIdentifier:source:)` to style the casing of alternative routes.
* Added the ability for the route line to disappear as the puck travels along a route during turn-by-turn navigation. ([#2377](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2377))
* Fixed an issue where the casing for the main route would not overlap alternative routes. ([#2377](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2377))
* Removed the `NavigationViewControllerDelegate.navigationViewController(_:imageFor:)` and `NavigationViewControllerDelegate.navigationViewController(_:viewFor:)` methods in favor of `MGLMapViewDelegate.mapView(_:imageFor:)` and `MGLMapViewDelegate.mapView(_:viewFor:)`, respectively. ([#2396](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2396))

## v0.40.0

### Packaging
* This SDK can no longer be used in applications written in pure Objective-C. If you need to use this SDK’s public API from Objective-C code, you will need to implement a wrapper in Swift that bridges the subset of the API you need from Swift to Objective-C. ([#2230](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2230))
* Added a new dependency on MapboxAccounts to prepare for upcoming improvements to how Mapbox [bills](https://www.mapbox.com/pricing/) this SDK’s usage of Mapbox APIs. If you use Carthage to install this SDK, remember to add MapboxAccounts.framework to the “Frameworks, Libraries, and Embedded Content” section and the input and output file lists of Carthage’s Run Script build phase. ([#2151](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2151))
* Upgraded to [Mapbox Maps SDK for iOS v5.6._x_](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native-ios/releases/tag/ios-v5.6.0). ([#2302](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2302))
* Fixed sporadic build failures after installing this SDK using CocoaPods. ([#2368](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2368))

### Top and bottom banners
* Removed `BottomBannerViewController(delegate:)` in favor of `BottomBannerViewController()` and the `BottomBannerViewController.delegate` property’s setter. ([#2297](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2297))
* Removed the `StatusView.canChangeValue` property in favor of `StatusView.isEnabled`. ([#2297](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2297))

### Map
* `UserCourseView` is now a type alias of the `UIView` class and the `CourseUpdatable` protocol rather than a protocol in its own right. ([#2230](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2230))
* Renamed `NavigationMapView.showRoutes(_:legIndex:)` to `NavigationMapView.show(_:legIndex:)`. ([#2230](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2230))
* Renamed `NavigationMapView.showWaypoints(_:legIndex:)` to `NavigationMapView.showWaypoints(on:legIndex:)`. ([#2230](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2230))
* Removed the `NavigationMapView.navigationMapDelegate` property in favor of `NavigationMapView.navigationMapViewDelegate`. ([#2297](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2297))
* Added a speed limit indicator to the upper-left corner of the map view during turn-by-turn navigation (upper-right corner in CarPlay). To hide the speed limit indicator, set the `NavigationViewController.showsSpeedLimits` property to `false`. To customize the indicator’s colors, configure `SpeedLimitView`’s appearance proxy inside a `Style` subclass. ([#2291](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2291))
* Fixed an issue where the current road name label contained an oversized route shield when the current map style was a custom style created in Mapbox Studio. ([#2357](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2357))

### Spoken instructions
* Removed `MapboxVoiceController.play(_:)` in favor of `MapboxVoiceController.play(instruction:data:)`. ([#2230](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2230), [#2297](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2297))
* The `MapboxVoiceController.speakWithDefaultSpeechSynthesizer(_:error:)` and `VoiceControllerDelegate.voiceController(_:spokenInstructionsDidFailWith:)` methods now accept a `SpeechError` instance instead of an `NSError` object. ([#2230](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2230))
* Added the `VoiceControllerDelegate.voiceController(_:didFallBackTo:becauseOf:)` method for detecting when the voice controller falls back to `AVSpeechSynthesizer`. ([#2230](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2230))

### User location
* Removed the `NavigationViewController.routeController` property and `LegacyRouteController(along:directions:dataSource:eventsManager:)`. To use `LegacyRouteController` instead of the default `RouteController` class, pass that type into `MapboxNavigationService(route:directions:locationSource:eventsManagerType:simulating:routerType:)`, pass the `MapboxNavigationService` object into `NavigationOptions(styles:navigationService:voiceController:topBanner:bottomBanner:)`, and pass the `NavigationOptions` object into `NavigationViewController(route:navigationService:)`. To access `LegacyRouteController`, use the `NavigationViewController.navigationService` and `NavigationService.router` properties and cast the value of `NavigationService.router` to a `LegacyRouteController`. ([#2297](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2297))
* Removed the `NavigationViewController.locationManager` and `LegacyRouteController.locationManager` properties in favor of `NavigationService.locationManager`. ([#2297](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2297))
* Removed `RouteLegProgress.upComingStep` in favor of `RouteLegProgress.upcomingStep`. ([#2297](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2297))
* Removed the `RouteProgress.nearbyCoordinates` property in favor of `RouteProgress.nearbyShape`. ([#2275](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2275), [#2275](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2275))
* Removed the `LegacyRouteController.tunnelIntersectionManager` property. ([#2297](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2297))

### Other changes
* Various delegate protocols now provide default no-op implementations for all their methods and conform to the `UnimplementedLogging` protocol, which can inform you at runtime when a delegate method is called but has not been implemented. This replaces the use of optional methods, which are disallowed in pure Swift protocols. Messages are sent through Apple Unified Logging and can be disabled globally through [Unifed Logging](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/os/logging#2878594), or by overriding the delegate function with a no-op implementation. ([#2230](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2230))
* Removed `NavigationViewController(for:styles:navigationService:voiceController:)` and `NavigationViewController(for:directions:styles:routeController:locationManager:voiceController:eventsManager:)` in favor of `NavigationViewController(route:options:)`. ([#2297](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2297))
* Removed the `EventsManager` type alias in favor of the `NavigationEventsManager` class. ([#2297](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2297))
* Removed the `NavigationViewController.eventsManager` and `LegacyRouteController.eventsManager` properties in favor of `NavigationService.eventsManager`. ([#2297](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2297))
* Removed the `NavigationViewController.carPlayManager(_:didBeginNavigationWith:window:delegate:)` and `NavigationViewController.carPlayManagerDidEndNavigation(_:window:)` methods. To mirror CarPlay navigation on the main device, present and dismiss a `NavigationViewController` in the `CarPlayManagerDelegate.carPlayManager(_:didBeginNavigationWith:)` and `CarPlayManagerDelegate.carPlayManagerDidEndNavigation(_:)` methods, respectively. ([#2297](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2297))
* When Dark Mode is enabled, user notifications now draw maneuver icons in white instead of black for better contrast. ([#2283](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2283))
* Added the `RouteLegProgress.currentSpeedLimit` property. ([#2114](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2114))
* Added convenience initializers for converting Turf geometry structures into `MGLShape` and `MGLFeature` objects such as `MGLPolyline` and `MGLPolygonFeature`. ([#2308](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2308))
* Fixed an issue where the “End Navigation” button in the end-of-route feedback panel appeared in English regardless of the current localization. ([#2315](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2315))

## v0.39.0

* Upgraded to [Mapbox Maps SDK for iOS v5.5.1](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native-ios/releases/tag/ios-v5.5.1). (#2341)
* Fixed an issue where the spoken instructions always fell back to VoiceOver when the `MGLMapboxAPIBaseURL` key was set in the Info.plist file. ([#2329](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2329))
* Fixed a crash when setting certain properties of a `Style` subclass to a dynamic color. ([#2338](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2338))

## v0.38.3

* Fixed a crash on launch if this SDK is installed using Carthage. ([#2317](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2317))
* Fixed a crash when the first visual instruction contained a route shield or exit number and the application’s user interface was written in SwiftUI. ([#2323](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2323))
* Fixed an issue where a black background could appear under the arrow in a `ManeuverView` regardless of the view’s `backgroundColor` property. ([#2279](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2279))
* Fixed an issue where the wrong style was applied to exit numbers in the top banner and for subsequent maneuver banners in CarPlay, resulting in poor contrast. ([#2280](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2280))

## v0.38.2

* Fixed a crash on launch if this SDK is installed using Carthage. ([#2301](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2301))

* Fixed an issue where the user puck appeared farther up the screen than the actual user location even while the camera pivoted around the user location at turns. ([#2211](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2211))
* Lock screen notifications are presented more reliably and more closely resemble instruction banners. ([#2206](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2206))
* Fixed an issue where manually incrementing `RouteProgress.legIndex` could lead to undefined behavior. ([#2229](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2229))
* `DistanceFormatter` now inherits directly from `Formatter` rather than `LengthFormatter`. ([#2206](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2206))
* Fixed an issue where `DistanceFormatter.attributedString(for:withDefaultAttributes:)` set `NSAttributedString.Key.quantity` to the original distance value rather than the potentially rounded value represented by the attributed string. ([#2206](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2206))

## v0.37.1

* Fixed a crash on launch if this SDK is installed using Carthage. ([#2301](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2301))

## v0.37.0

* Fixed an issue where a second swipe down on the top banner causes an open `StepsTableViewController` to animate incorrectly. ([#2197](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2197))
* Added the `NavigationViewControllerDelegate.navigationViewController(_:didUpdate:location:rawLocation:)` method for capturing progress updates without having to inject a class between the `NavigationViewController` and the `NavigationService`. ([#2224](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2224))
* Fixed an issue where the bottom banner can disappear when presenting in `UIModalPresentationStyle.fullScreen` in iOS 13.  ([#2182](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2182))

## v0.36.0

* Fixed an issue where InstructionsBannerView remained the same color after switching to a day or night style. ([#2178](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2178))
* Fixed an issue where `NavigationMapView` showed routes without congestion attributes, such as `MBDirectionsProfileIdentifier.walking` routes, as translucent lines, even if the route had only one leg. ([#2193](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2193))
* Fixed an issue where the “iPhone Volume Low” banner would persist until replaced by another banner about simulation or rerouting. ([#2183](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2183))
* Designables no longer crash and fail to render in Interface Builder when the application target links to this SDK via CocoaPods. ([#2179](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2179))
* Fixed a crash that could occur when statically initializing a `Style` if the SDK was installed using CocoaPods. ([#2179](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2179))
* Fixed incorrect animation of instruction labels when presenting the step list. ([#2185](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2185))

## v0.35.0

* Upgraded to [Mapbox Maps SDK for iOS v5.1.0](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/releases/tag/ios-v5.1.0). ([#2134](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2134))
* Added the ability to define a custom view controller for the top banner via `NavigationOptions.topBanner`. ([#2121](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2121))
* StyleManager now posts a `StyleManagerDidApplyStyleNotification` when a style gets applied due to a change of day of time, or when entering or exiting a tunnel. ([#2148](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2148))
* Fixed a crash when presenting `NavigationViewController` on iOS 13.0. ([#2156](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2156))
* Added a setter to the `Router.reroutesProactively` property. ([#2157](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2157))
* Added a Yoruba localization. ([#2159](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2159))

## v0.34.0

* Upgraded to [Mapbox Maps SDK for iOS v5.0.0](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/releases/tag/ios-v5.0.0), which changes [how monthly active users are counted](https://www.mapbox.com/52219). ([#2133](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2133))
* Deprecated `StatusViewDelegate` in favor of calling the `UIControl.addTarget(_:action:for:)` method on `StatusView` for `UIControl.Event.valueChanged`. ([#2136](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2136))
* Fixed an issue where the status view showed a simulated speed factor as an unformatted number. ([#2136](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2136))
* Fixed an issue preventing the status view from appearing while rerouting. ([#2137](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2137))
* The `RouteOptions.alleyPriority`, `RouteOptions.walkwayPriority`, and `RouteOptions.speed` properties now work when calculating walking routes offline. ([#2142](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2142))

## v0.33.0

* Restored the compass to `CarPlayNavigationViewController`, now displaying a digital readout of the direction of travel, represented by the `CarPlayCompassView` class. ([#2077](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2077))

## v0.32.0

### Core Navigation

* Fixed an issue where `RouteControllerNotificationUserInfoKey.isProactiveKey` was not set to `true` in `Notification.Name.routeControllerDidReroute` notifications after proactively rerouting the user. ([#2086](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2086))
* Fixed an issue where `LegacyRouteController` failed to call `NavigationServiceDelegate.navigationService(_:didPassSpokenInstructionPoint:routeProgress:)` and omitted `RouteControllerNotificationUserInfoKey.spokenInstructionKey` from `Notification.Name.routeControllerDidPassSpokenInstructionPoint` notifications. ([#2089](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2089))
* Fixed an issue where `SimulatedLocationManager`’s distance did not update in response to updating the `Router`’s route, causing the user puck to be snapped to an invalid location on the new route. ([#2096](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2096))
* `NavigationMatchOptions.shapeFormat` now defaults to `RouteShapeFormat.polyline6` for consistency with `NavigationRouteOptions` and compatibility with the `RouteController`. ([#2084](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2084))
* Fixed an issue where the user location was unsnapped when the user’s course was unavailable. ([#2092](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2092))
* Fixed an issue where a failed rerouting request prevented `LegacyRouteController` from ever rerouting the user again. ([#2093](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2093))

### CarPlay

* Fixed an issue where the remaining distance and travel time displayed during turn-by-turn navigation were calculated relative to the upcoming waypoint instead of the final destination. ([#2119](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2119))
* Deprecated `CarPlayManager.overviewButton` in favor of `CarPlayManager.userTrackingButton`, which updates the icon correctly when panning out of tracking state. ([#2100](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2100))
* When previewing a route, the distance and estimated travel time are displayed at the bottom of the window. ([#2120](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2120))
* By default, the destination waypoint name is no longer displayed a second time when previewing a route. To add a subtitle to the preview, implement the `CarPlayManagerDelegate.carPlayManager(_:willPreview:)` method; create an `MKMapItem` whose `MKPlacemark` has the `Street` key in its address dictionary. ([#2120](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2119))

### Other changes

* Fixed compiler warnings in Xcode 10.2 when installing the SDK using CocoaPods. ([#2087](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2087))
* Fixed an issue where the user puck could float around while the user is at rest or moving in reverse. ([#2109](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2109))

## v0.31.0

* Fixed a number of warnings and errors when building the SDK from source using CocoaPods in Swift 4.2. ([#2058](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2058))
* Restored “Declaration” and “Parameters” sections throughout the API reference. ([#2076](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2076))
* Deprecated `NavigationMapView.navigationMapDelegate` in favor of `NavigationMapView.navigationMapViewDelegate`. ([#2061](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2061))
* The `NavigationMapView.navigationMapViewDelegate` and `RouteVoiceController.voiceControllerDelegate` properties are now accessible in Objective-C. ([#2061](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2061))
* The sources added to the style by `NavigationMapView.showRoutes(_:legIndex:)` once again enables `MGLShapeSourceOptions.lineDistanceMetrics`. ([#2071](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2071))
* Deprecated `NavigationDirections.configureRouter(tilesURL:translationsURL:completionHandler:)` in favor of `NavigationDirections.configureRouter(tilesURL:completionHandler:)`. ([#2079](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2079))
* Fixed a crash that occurred if the `Route` lacked `SpokenInstruction` data, such as if the request was made using `RouteOptions` instead of `NavigationRouteOptions` or if the route was generated by a non-Mapbox API. ([#2079](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2079))

## v0.30.0

### Core Navigation

* Fixed an issue where the wrong instruction could be announced or a crash could occur near maneuvers when using a `RouteController`. ([#2004](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2004), [#2029](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2029))
* Restored the `RouteController.reroutesProactively` property. By default, `RouteController` and `LegacyRouteController` proactively check for a faster route on an interval defined by `RouteControllerProactiveReroutingInterval`. ([#1986](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1986))
* Added a `RouteControllerMinimumDurationRemainingForProactiveRerouting` global variable to customize when `RouteController` stops looking for more optimal routes as the user nears the destination. ([#1986](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1986))
* Fixed a bug which would cancel an ongoing reroute request when the request takes longer than one second to complete. ([#1986](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1986))
* Fixed an issue where rerouting would ignore any waypoints from the original route options where the `Waypoint.separatesLegs` property was set to `false`. ([#2014](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2014))

### CarPlay

* Removed `NavigationViewController.carPlayManager(_:didBeginNavigationWith:window:)` that created and presented a `NavigationViewController`. Have your `NavigationViewControllerDelegate` (such as a `UIViewController` subclass, or a discrete delegate) create and present a `NavigationViewController`. ([#2045](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2045))
* Removed `NavigationViewController.carPlayManagerDidEndNaviation(_:window:)`. Have your `NavigationViewControllerDelegate` (such as a `UIViewController` subclass, or a discrete delegate) dismiss the active `NavigationViewController`. ([#2045](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2045))

* Renamed the `MapboxVoiceController(speechClient:dataCache:audioPlayerType:)` initializer to `MapboxVoiceController(navigationService:speechClient:dataCache:audioPlayerType:)` and the `RouteVoiceController()` initializer to `RouteVoiceController(navigationService:)`. ([#2018](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2018))
* Added the `CarPlayManagerDelegate.carPlayManager(_:didFailToFetchRouteBetween:options:error:)` method, which allows you to present an alert on the map template when a route request fails. ([#1981](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1981))
* A modal alert is no longer displayed when the user arrives at an intermediate waypoint. This fixes a crash that occurred when the user tapped the Continue button. ([#2005](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2005))
* Added the `CarPlayNavigationViewController.navigationService` property. ([#2005](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2005))
* `CarPlayNavigationDelegate.carPlayNavigationViewControllerDidDismiss(_:byCanceling:)` is now optional. ([#2005](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2005))
* Removed the `CarPlayNavigationDelegate.carPlayNavigationViewControllerDidArrive(_:)` method in favor of `NavigationServiceDelegate.navigationService(_:didArriveAt:)`. ([#2005](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2005), [#2025](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2025))
* Fixed an issue where the camera would sometimes fail to animate properly when returning to the browsing activity. [#2022](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2022))
* Removed the compass from `CarPlayNavigationViewController`. ([#2051](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2051))

### Other changes

* Fixed an issue where the turn banner stayed blank when using a `RouteController`. ([#1996](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1996))
* The `BottomBannerViewController` now accounts for the safe area inset if present. ([#1982](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1982))
* Deprecated `BottomBannerViewController(delegate:)`. Set the `BottomBannerViewController.delegate` property separately after initializing a `BottomBannerViewController`. ([#2027](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2027))
* The map now pans when the user drags a `UserCourseView`. ([#2012](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2012))
* Added a Japanese localization. ([#2032](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2032))
* Fixed a compiler error when rendering a `NavigationViewController` designable inside an Interface Builder storyboard. ([#2039](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2039))
* Fixed an issue where the user puck moved around onscreen while tracking the user’s location. ([#2047](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2047))
* Fixed an issue where the user puck briefly moved away from the route line as the user completed a turn. ([#2047](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/2047))

## v0.29.1

### Core Navigation

* Fixed an issue where `RouteController` could not advance to a subsequent leg along the route. ([#1979](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1979))
* Fixed an issue where the turn banner remained blank and  `RouterDelegate.router(_:didPassVisualInstructionPoint:routeProgress:)` was never called if `MapboxNavigationService` was created with a `LegacyRouteController` router. ([#1983](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1983))
* Fixed an issue causing `LegacyRouteController` to prematurely advance to the next step when receiving an unreliable course from Core Location. ([#1989](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1989))

### Other changes

* Fixed an issue preventing `CarPlayMapViewController` and `CarPlayNavigationViewController` from applying custom map styles. ([#1985](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1985))
* Renamed `-[MBStyleManagerDelegate styleManager:didApply:]` to `-[MBStyleManagerDelegate styleManager:didApplyStyle:]` in Objective-C. If your `StyleManagerDelegate`-conforming class is written in Swift, make sure its methods match `StyleManagerDelegate`’s method signatures, including `@objc` annotations. ([#1985](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1985))

## v0.29.0

### Core Navigation

* `PortableRouteController` has been renamed to `RouteController`. The previous `RouteController` has been renamed to `LegacyRouteController` and will be removed in a future release. ([#1904](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1904))
* Added the `MapboxNavigationService.router(_:didPassVisualInstructionPoint:routeProgress:)` and `MapboxNavigationService.router(_:didPassSpokenInstructionPoint:routeProgress:)` methods, which correspond to `Notification.Name.routeControllerDidPassVisualInstructionPoint` and `Notification.Name.routeControllerDidPassSpokenInstructionPoint`, respectively. ([#1912](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1912))

You can now access map buttons that perform built-in actions on the map by accessing read-only properties such as: `CarPlayManager.exitButton`, `CarPlayManager.muteButton`, `CarPlayManager.showFeedbackButton`, `CarPlayManager.overviewButton`, `CarPlayMapViewController.recenterButton`, `CarPlayMapViewController.zoomInButton`, `CarPlayMapViewController.zoomOutButton`, `CarPlayMapViewController.panningInterfaceDisplayButton(for:)`, `CarPlayMapViewController.panningInterfaceDismissalButton(for:)`. ([#1962](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1962))

### Other changes

* Replaced `NavigationViewController(for:styles:navigationService:viewController:)` with `NavigationViewController(for:options:)`, which accepts a `NavigationOptions` object (not to be confused with `NavigationRouteOptions`). `NavigationOptions` contains various options for customizing the user experience of a turn-by-turn navigation session, including replacing the bottom banner with a custom view controller. ([#1951](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1951))
* Restored “Declaration” and “Parameters” sections throughout the API reference. ([#1952](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1952))

([#1964](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1964))
* The `NavigationViewController.navigationService` property is now read-only. ([#1965](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1965]))
* CarPlayManager now offers its delegate the opportunity to customize a trip and its related preview text configuration before displaying it for preview ([#1955](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1955))

## v0.28.0 (January 23, 2018)

* Xcode 10 or above is now required for building this SDK. ([#1936](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1936))
* Search functionality on CarPlay is now managed by `CarPlaySearchController`. Added the `CarPlayManagerDelegate.carPlayManager(_:selectedPreviewFor:using:)` method for any additional customization after a trip is selected on CarPlay. ([#1846](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1846))
* Added the `NavigationViewController.showEndOfRouteFeedback(duration:completionHandler:)` method for showing the end-of-route feedback UI after manually ending a navigation session. ([#1932](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1932))
* Fixed inaudible spoken instructions while other audio is playing. ([#1933](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1933))
* Fixed an issue where setting `Router.route` did not update `SimulatedLocationManager.route`. ([#1928](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1928))
* Fixed an issue where U-turn lane was displayed as a U-turn to the right even in regions that drive on the right. ([#1910](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1910))
* Fixed an issue where a left-or-through lane was displayed as a right turn lane. ([#1910](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1910))
* Programmatically setting `Router.route` no longer causes `NavigationViewControllerDelegate.navigationViewController(_:shouldRerouteFrom:)` or `RouterDelegate.router(_:shouldRerouteFrom:)` to be called. ([#1931](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1931))
* Fixed redundant calls to `NavigationViewControllerDelegate.navigationViewController(_:shouldRerouteFrom:)` and `RouterDelegate.router(_:shouldRerouteFrom:)` when rerouting repeatedly. ([#1930](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1930))

## v0.27.0 (December 20, 2018)

* The `NavigationDirections.unpackTilePack(at:outputDirectoryURL:progressHandler:completionHandler:)` method is now available to Objective-C code as `-[MBNavigationDirections unpackTilePackAtURL:outputDirectoryURL:progressHandler:completionHandler:]`. ([#1891](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1891))
* Added support for styles powered by [version 8 of the Mapbox Streets source](https://docs.mapbox.com/vector-tiles/mapbox-streets-v8/). ([#1909](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1909))
* Fixed potential inaccuracies in location snapping, off-route detection, and the current road name label. ([mapbox/turf-swift#74](https://github.com/mapbox/turf-swift/pull/74))

## v0.26.0 (December 6, 2018)

### Client-side routing

* Added a `NavigationDirections` class that manages offline tile packs and client-side route calculation. ([#1808](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1808))
* Extended `Bundle` with `Bundle.suggestedTileURL` and other properties to facilitate offline downloads. ([#1808](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1808))

### CarPlay

* When selecting a search result in CarPlay, the resulting routes lead to the search result’s routable location when available. Routes to a routable location are more likely to be passable. ([#1859](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1859))
* Fixed an issue where the CarPlay navigation map’s vanishing point and user puck initially remained centered on screen, instead of accounting for the maneuver panel, until the navigation bar was shown. ([#1856](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1856))
* Fixed an issue where route shields and exit numbers appeared blurry in the maneuver panel on CarPlay devices and failed to appear in the CarPlay simulator. ([#1868](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1868))
* Added `VisualInstruction.containsLaneIndications`, `VisualInstruction.maneuverImageSet(side:)`, `VisualInstruction.shouldFlipImage(side:)`, and `VisualInstruction.carPlayManeuverLabelAttributedText(bounds:shieldHeight:window:)`. ([#1860](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1860))

* Fixed spurious rerouting on multi-leg routes. ([#1884](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1884))
* Fixed a hang that occurred when failing to fetch a route shield image for display in a visual instruction banner. ([#1888](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1888))
* Adding property `RouteController.nearbyCoordinates`, which offers similar behavior to `RouteLegProgress.nearbyCoordinates`, which the addition of step lookahead/lookbehind in multi-leg routes. ([#1883](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1883))
* The `MGLShapeSourceOptions.lineDistanceMetrics` property has been temporarily disabled from the route line shape source due to a crash. This means it isn’t possible to set the `MGLLineStyleLayer.lineGradient` property on the route line style layers. ([#1886](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1886))

## v0.25.0 (November 22, 2018)

### CarPlay

* Renamed `CarPlayManager.calculateRouteAndStart(from:to:completionHandler:)` to `CarPlayManager.previewRoutes(between:completionHandler:)` and added a `CarplayManager.previewRoutes(to:completionHandler)`, as well as a `CarPlayManager.previewRoutes(for:completionHandler:)` method that accepts an arbitrary `NavigationRouteOptions` object. ([#1841](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1841))
* Fixed an issue causing `UserCourseView` to lag behind `NavigationMapView` whenever the map’s camera or content insets change significantly or when the map rotates. ([#1838](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1838))
* Renamed `CarPlayManager(_:)` to `CarPlayManager(styles:directions:eventsManager:)` and `CarPlayNavigationViewController(with:mapTemplate:interfaceController:manager:styles:)` to `CarPlayNavigationViewController(navigationService:mapTemplate:interfaceController:manager:styles:)`. These initializers now accept an array of `Style` objects to apply throughout the CarPlay interface, similar to `NavigationViewController`. You can also change the styles at any time by setting the `CarPlayManager.styles` property. ([#1836](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1836))
* `CarPlayManager(styles:directions:eventsManager:)` also allows you to pass in a custom `Directions` object to use when calculating routes. ([#1834](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1834/))
* Removed the `StyleManager(_:)` initializer. After initializing a `StyleManager` object, set the `StyleManager.delegate` property to ensure that the style manager’s settings take effect. ([#1836](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1836))
* Added `CarPlayManager.mapView` and `CarPlayNavigationViewController.mapView` properties. ([#1852](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1852))
* Some additional members of `CarPlayManager` are now accessible in Objective-C code. ([#1836](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1836))
* Fixed an issue where distances are incorrectly displayed as “0 m” in regions that use the metric system. ([#1854](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1854))
* Fixed an issue where the user puck pointed away from the route line during turn-by-turn navigation in CarPlay. The map’s vanishing point now accounts for safe area insets, including the side maneuver view. ([#1845](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1845))
* Fixed an issue where the map view used for browsing and previewing failed to call `MGLMapViewDelegate.mapView(_:viewFor:)` and `MGLMapViewDelegate.mapViewWillStartLocatingUser(_:)`. ([#1852](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1852))
* You can now create a `UserPuckCourseView` using the `UserPuckCourseView(frame:)` initializer. ([#1852](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1852))

### Other changes

* Fixed a crash during turn-by-turn navigation. ([#1820](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1820))

* Fixed an issue causing MapboxVoiceController to speak instructions using VoiceOver instead of the Mapbox Voice API. ([#1830](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/issues/1830))
* Added `NavigationViewController.navigationService(_:willArriveAt:after:distance:)` to assist with preparations for arrival. ([#1847](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1847))

## v0.24.0 (November 7, 2018)

* It is now safe to set the `NavigationMapView.delegate` property of the `NavigationMapView` in `NavigationViewController.mapView`. Implement `MGLMapViewDelegate` in your own class to customize annotations and other details. ([#1601](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1601))
* Fixed an issue where the map view while navigating in CarPlay showed labels in the style’s original language instead of the local language. ([#1601](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1601))
* Fixed an issue where rerouting could still occur after arrival, even though `NavigationServiceDelegate.navigationService(_:shouldPreventReroutesWhenArrivingAt:)` returned `true`. ([#1833](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1833))
* `NavigationMapViewDelegate.navigationMapView(_:routeStyleLayerWithIdentifier:source:)`, `NavigationMapViewDelegate.navigationMapView(_:routeCasingStyleLayerWithIdentifier:source:)`, `NavigationViewControllerDelegate.navigationViewController(_:routeStyleLayerWithIdentifier:source:)`, and `NavigationViewControllerDelegate.navigationViewController(_:routeCasingStyleLayerWithIdentifier:source:)` can now set the `MGLLineStyleLayer.lineGradient` property. ([#1799](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1799))
* Reduced the `NavigationMapView.minimumFramesPerSecond` property’s default value from 30 frames per second to 20 frames per second for improved performance on battery power. ([#1819](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1819))

## v0.23.0 (October 24, 2018)
* `CarPlayManager` is no longer a singleton; your application delegate is responsible for creating and owning an instance of this class. This fixes a crash in applications that specify the access token programmatically instead of in the Info.plist file. ([#1792](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1792))
* `NavigationService.start()` now sets the first coordinate on a route, if a fixed location isn't available the first few seconds of a navigation session. ([#1790](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1790))

## v0.22.3 (October 17, 2018)

* Fixed over-retain issue that resulted in the `MapboxNavigationService` persisting beyond its expected lifecycle. This could cause unexpected behavior with components that observe progress noitifications.
* Fixed warnings caused by internal usage of deprecated types.

## v0.22.2 (October 15, 2018)

* Fixed an issue where the U-turn icon in the turn banner pointed in the wrong direction. ([#1647](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1647))
* Fixed an issue where the user puck was positioned too close to the bottom of the map view, underlapping the current road name label. ([#1766](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1766))
* Added `InstructionsBannerView.showStepIndicator` to enable showing/hiding the drag indicator ([#1772](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1772))
* Renamed `EventsManager` to `NavigationEventsManager`. ([#1767](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1767))
* Added support in `NavigationEventsManager` that allows for routeless events. ([#1767](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1767))

## v0.22.1 (October 2, 2018)

### User Location

* Added ability to adjust `poorGPSPatience` of a `NavigationService`. [#1763](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1763)
* Increased default Poor-GPS patience of `MapboxNavigationService` to 2.5 seconds. [#1763](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1763)
* Fixed an issue where the map view while navigating in CarPlay displayed the day style even at night. ([#1762](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1762))

## v0.22.0 (October 1, 2018)

### Packaging

* Added a dependency on the Mapbox Navigation Native framework. If you use Carthage to install this framework, your target should also link against `MapboxNavigationNative.framework`. ([#1618](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1618))

### User location

* Added a `NavigationService` protocol implemented by classes that provide location awareness functionality. Our default implementation, `MapboxNavigationService` conforms to this protocol. ([#1602](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1602))
  * Added a new `Router` protocol, which allows for custom route-following logic. Our default implementation, `RouteController`, conforms to this protocol.
  * `NavigationViewController.init(for:styles:directions:styles:routeController:locationManager:voiceController:eventsManager)` has been renamed `NavigationViewController.init(for:styles:navigationService:voiceController:)`.
  * `NavigationViewController.routeController` has been replaced by `NavigationViewController.navigationService`.
  * If you currently use `RouteController` directly, you should migrate to `MapboxNavigationService`.
  * If you currently use `SimulatedLocationManager` directly, you should instead pass `SimulationOption.always` into `MapboxNavigationService(route:directions:locationSource:eventsManagerType:simulating:)`.
  * Note: the `MapboxNavigationService`, by default, will start simulating progress if more than 1.5 seconds elapses without any update from the GPS. This can happen when simulating locations in Xcode, or selecting the "Custom Location" simulation option in the iOS Simulator. This is normal behavior.
* Improved the reliability of off-route detection. ([#1618](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1618))

### User interface

* `StyleManagerDelegate.locationFor(styleManager:)` has been renamed to `StyleManagerDelegate.location(for:)`  ([#1724](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1724))
* Fixed inaccurate maneuver arrows along the route line when the route doubles back on itself. ([#1735](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1735))
* Added an `InstructionsBannerView.swipeable` property that allows the user to swipe the banner to the side to preview future steps. The `InstructionsBannerViewDelegate.didDragInstructionsBanner(_:)` method has been deprecated in favor of `InstructionsBannerViewDelegate.didSwipeInstructionsBanner(_:swipeDirection:)`. ([#1750](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1750))
* `NavigationMapView` no longer mutates its own frame rate implicitly. A new `NavigationMapView.updatePreferredFrameRate(for:)` method allows you to update the frame rate in response to route progress change notifications. The `NavigationMapView.minimumFramesPerSecond` property determines the frame rate while the application runs on battery power. By default, the map views in `NavigationViewController` and CarPlay’s navigation activity animate at a higher frame rate on battery power than before. ([#1749](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1749))
* Fixed a crash that occurred when the end of route view controller appears, showing the keyboard. ([#1754](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1754))

## v0.21.0 (September 17, 2018)

### User interface

* In CarPlay-enabled applications on iOS 12, this SDK now displays a map, search interface, and turn-by-turn navigation experience on the connected CarPlay device. The CarPlay screen is managed by the shared `CarPlayManager` object, which you can configure by implementing the `CarPlayManagerDelegate` protocol. ([#1714](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1714))
* Added the `Style.previewMapStyleURL` property for customizing the style displayed by a preview map. ([#1695](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1695))

### User location

* Breaking change: The `eventsManager` argument of `RouteController(along:directions:locationManager:eventsManager:)` is now required. `NavigationViewController(for:directions:styles:locationManager:voiceController:eventsManager:)` now has an optional `eventsManager` argument, which is passed to any instance of `RouteController` created as a result of rerouting. ([#1671](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1671))
* Fixed issues where the user puck would overshoot a turn or drift away from a curved road. ([#1710](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1710))
* Fixed incorrect conversions to inches in `DistanceFormatter`. ([#1699](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1699))
* Fixed several crashes related to telemetry collection. ([#1668](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1668))

## v0.20.1 (September 10, 2018)

* Upgraded mapbox-events-ios to v0.5.0 to avoid a potential incompatibility when using Carthage to install the SDK.
* Fixed a bug which prevented automatic day and night style switching. ([#1629](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1629))

## v0.20.0 (September 6, 2018)

### User interface

* While traveling on a numbered road, the route number is displayed in a shield beside the current road name at the bottom of the map. ([#1576](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1576))
* Added the `shouldManageApplicationIdleTimer` flag to `NavigationViewController` to allow applications to opt out of automatic `UIApplication.isIdleTimerDisabled` management. ([#1591](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1591))
* Added various methods, properties, and initializers to `StatusView`, allowing you to use it in a custom user interface. ([#1612](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1612))
* Added `StyleManager.automaticallyAdjustsStyleForTimeOfDay`, `StyleManager.delegate`, and `StyleManager.styles` properties so that you can control same time-based style switching just as `NavigationViewController` does. [#1617](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1617)
* Fixed an issue where the banner was stuck on rerouting past the reroute threshold when simulating navigation. ([#1583](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1583))
* Fixed an issue where the banner appears in the wrong colors after you tap the Resume button. ([#1588](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1588), [#1589](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1589))
* `NavigationMapView`’s user puck now responds to changes to the safe area insets while tracking the user’s location, matching the behavior of the map camera. ([#1653](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1653))
* Added `StepsViewControllerDelegate` and `InstructionsBannerViewDelegate` which makes it possible to listen in on tap events that occur in `StepsViewController` and `InstructionsBannerView`. [#1633](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1633)

### Feedback

* Added a `FeedbackViewController` class for soliciting feedback from the user in a custom user interface. ([#1605](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1605))
* Replaced `NavigationViewControllerDelegate.navigationViewControllerDidOpenFeedback(_:)` with `FeedbackViewControllerDelegate.feedbackViewControllerDidOpen(_:)`, `NavigationViewControllerDelegate.navigationViewControllerDidCancelFeedback(_:)` with `FeedbackViewControllerDelegate.feedbackViewController(_:didSend:uuid:)`, and `NavigationViewControllerDelegate.navigationViewController(_:didSendFeedbackAssigned:feedbackType)` with `FeedbackViewControllerDelegate.feedbackViewControllerDidCancel(_:)`. ([#1605](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1605))
* Fixed a crash that occurred when the end of route view controller appears, showing the keyboard. ([#1599](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1599/))

### Other changes

* Added a `MapboxVoiceController.audioPlayer` property. You can use this property to interrupt a spoken instruction or adjust the volume. ([#1596](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1596))
* Fixed a memory leak when `RouteController.isDeadReckoningEnabled` is enabled. ([#1624](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1624))

## v0.19.2 (August 23, 2018)

* The `MGLStyle.navigationGuidanceDayStyleURL` and `MGLStyle.navigationGuidanceNightStyleURL` properties now return [version 4 of the Mapbox Navigation Guidance Day and Night styles](https://blog.mapbox.com/incidents-are-live-on-the-map-beeff6b84bf9), respectively. These styles indicate incidents such as road closures and detours. ([#1619](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1619))
* Added an `MGLMapView.showsIncidents` property to toggle the visibility of any Mapbox Incidents data on a map view. ([#1613](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1613))

## v0.19.1 (August 15, 2018)

* Fixed build errors when installing this SDK with Mapbox Maps SDK for iOS v4.3.0 or above. ([#1608](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1608), [#1609](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1609))

## v0.19.0 (July 24, 2018)

### Packaging

* Moved guides and examples to [a new Mapbox Navigation SDK for iOS website](https://docs.mapbox.com/ios/navigation/). ([#1552](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1552))
* Applications intended for use in mainland China can set the `MGLMapboxAPIBaseURL` key in Info.plist to `https://api.mapbox.cn/` to use China-optimized APIs. This setting causes `NavigationMapView` to default to China-optimized day and night styles with places and roads labeled in Simplified Chinese. ([#1558](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1558))

### User interface

* Fixed an issue where selecting a step from the steps list would take the user to the wrong step. ([#1524](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1524/))
* The `StyleManagerDelegate.locationFor(styleManager:)` method’s return value is now optional. ([#1523](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1523))
* `NavigationViewController` smoothly fades between light and dark status bars. ([#1535](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1535))
* Renamed the `InstructionsBannerView.updateInstruction(_:)` method to `InstructionsBannerView.update(for:)`. Added the `NextBannerView.update(for:)` and `LanesView.update(for:)` methods. These methods are intended to be called in response to `Notification.Name.routeControllerDidPassVisualInstructionPoint` if the views are used outside a `NavigationViewController`. By contrast, `InstructionsBannerView.updateDistance(for:)` should be called on every location update. ([#1514](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1514))
* Added the `ManeuverView.visualInstruction` and `ManeuverView.drivingSide` properties. ([#1514](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1514))

## v0.18.1 (June 19, 2018)

### Packaging

* Increased the minimum deployment target of Core Navigation to iOS 9. ([#1494](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1494))

### User interface

* Added `NavigationMapView.recenterMap()` for recentering the map if a user gesture causes it to stop following the user. ([#1471](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1471))
* Deprecated `NavigationViewController.usesNightStyleInsideTunnels`. Style switching is enabled as a side effect of `TunnelIntersectionManager.tunnelSimulationEnabled`, which is set to `true` by default. ([#1489]
* Fixed an issue where the user location view slid around after the user pressed the Overview button. [#1506](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1506)

### Core Navigation

* Moved `RouteController.tunnelSimulationEnabled` to `TunnelIntersectionManager.tunnelSimulationEnabled`. ([#1489](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1489))
(https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1489))
* Added `RouteControllerDelegate.routeControllerWillDisableBatteryMonitoring(_:)` which allows developers control whether battery monitoring is disabled when `RouteController.deinit()` is called. [#1476](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1476)
* Fixed an issue where setting `NavigationLocationManager.desiredAccuracy` had no effect. [#1481](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1481)

## v0.18.0 (June 5, 2018)

### User interface

* Added support for generic route shields. Image-backed route shields also now display as generic (instead of plain text) while the SDK loads the image. [#1190](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/issues/1190), [#1417](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1417)
* Fixed an issue when going into overhead mode with a short route. [#1456](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1456/)
* Adds support for Xcode 10 Beta 1. [#1499](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1499), [#1478](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1478)

### Core Navigation

* `TunnelIntersectionManagerDelegate` methods no longer take a completion handler argument. ([#1414](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1414))
* Added the ability to render more than 1 alternate route. [#1372](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1372/)
* `NavigationMapViewDelegate.navigationMapView(_:shapeFor:)` Now expects an array of `Route`. The first route will be rendered as the main route, all subsequent routes will be rendered as alternate routes.
* Animating the user through tunnels and automatically switching the map style when entering a tunnel is now on by default. [#1449](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1449)
* Adds `RouteControllerDelegate.routeController(_:shouldPreventReroutesWhenArrivingAt:waypoint:)` which is called each time a driver arrives at a waypoint. By default, this method returns true and prevents rerouting upon arriving. Progress updates still occur. [#1454](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1454/)

## v0.17.0 (May 14, 2018)

### Packaging

* Upgraded to the [Mapbox Maps SDK for iOS v4.0.0](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/releases/tag/ios-v4.0.0). If you have customized the route map’s appearance, you may need to migrate your code to use expressions instead of style functions. ([#1076](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1076))
* Added a Korean localization. ([#1346](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1346))

### User interface

* Exit indications are now drawn accurately with a correct exit heading. ([#1288](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1288))
* Added the `NavigationViewControllerDelegate.navigationViewController(_:roadNameAt:)` method for customizing the contents of the road name label that appears towards the bottom of the map view. ([#1309](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1309))
* If the SDK tries but fails to reroute the user, the “Rerouting…” status view no longer stays visible permanently. ([#1357](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1357))
* Completed waypoints now remain on the map but are slightly translucent. ([#1364](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1364))
* Fixed an issue preventing `NavigationViewController.navigationMapView(_:simplifiedShapeDescribing:)` (now `NavigationViewController.navigationMapView(_:simplifiedShapeFor:)`) from being called. ([#1413](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1413))

### Spoken instructions

* Fixed an issue causing the wrong instructions to be spoken. ([#1396](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1396))

### User location

* The `RouteController.routeProgress` property is now available in Objective-C. ([#1323](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1323))
* Added a `RouteController.tunnelSimulationEnabled` option that keeps the user location indicator moving steadily while the user travels through a tunnel and GPS reception is unreliable. ([#1218](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1218))

### Other changes

* `DistanceFormatter`, `ReplayLocationManager`, `SimulatedLocationManager`, `LanesView`, and `ManueverView` are now subclassable. ([#1345](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1345))
* Renamed many `NavigationViewController` and `NavigationMapViewDelegate` methods ([#1364](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1364), [#1338](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1338), [#1318](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1318), [#1378](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1378), [#1413](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1413)):
    * `NavigationViewControllerDelegate.navigationViewControllerDidCancelNavigation(_:)` to `NavigationViewControllerDelegate.navigationViewControllerDidDismiss(_:byCanceling:)`
    * `-[MBNavigationViewControllerDelegate navigationViewController:didArriveAt:]` to `-[MBNavigationViewControllerDelegate navigationViewController:didArriveAtWaypoint:]` in Objective-C
    * `NavigationViewControllerDelegate.navigationMapView(_:routeStyleLayerWithIdentifier:source:)` to `NavigationViewControllerDelegate.navigationViewController(_:routeStyleLayerWithIdentifier:source:)`
    * `NavigationViewControllerDelegate.navigationMapView(_:routeCasingStyleLayerWithIdentifier:source:)` to `NavigationViewControllerDelegate.navigationViewController(_:routeCasingStyleLayerWithIdentifier:source:)`
    * `NavigationViewControllerDelegate.navigationMapView(_:shapeFor:)` to `NavigationViewControllerDelegate.navigationViewController(_:shapeFor:)`
    * `NavigationViewControllerDelegate.navigationMapView(_:simplifiedShapeFor:)` to `NavigationViewControllerDelegate.navigationViewController(_:simplifiedShapeFor:)`
    * `NavigationViewControllerDelegate.navigationMapView(_:waypointStyleLayerWithIdentifier:source:)` to `NavigationViewControllerDelegate.navigationViewController(_:waypointStyleLayerWithIdentifier:source:)`
    * `NavigationViewControllerDelegate.navigationMapView(_:waypointSymbolStyleLayerWithIdentifier:source:)` to `NavigationViewControllerDelegate.navigationViewController(_:waypointSymbolStyleLayerWithIdentifier:source:)`
    * `NavigationViewControllerDelegate.navigationMapView(_:shapeFor:legIndex:)` to `NavigationViewControllerDelegate.navigationViewController(_:shapeFor:legIndex:)`
    * `NavigationViewControllerDelegate.navigationMapView(_:didTap:)` to `NavigationViewControllerDelegate.navigationViewController(_:didSelect:)`

### Core Navigation

* Fixed a crash that was caused by check the edit distance of an empty string. [#1281](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1281/)
* Removes warnings when using Swift 4.1. [#1271](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1271)

### Spoken instructions

* Fixed an issue that would preemptively fallback to the default speech synthesizer. [#1284](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1284)

## v0.16.0 (March 26, 2018)

### User interface
* While the user travels through a tunnel, `NavigationMapView` temporarily applies a night style (a style whose `styleType` property is set to `StyleType.night`). ([#1127](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1127))
* The user can reveal the list of upcoming steps by swiping downward from the top banner. ([#1150](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1150))
* Renamed `StyleType.dayStyle` and `StyleType.nightStyle` to `StyleType.day` and `StyleType.night`, respectively. ([#1250](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1250))
* Fixed an issue causing the overview map to insist on centering the route upon each location update. ([#1223](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1223))

* Adds a handle at the bottom of the banner to reveals additional instructions. ([#1253](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1253))

### Spoken instructions
* Audio data for spoken instructions is cached in device storage to minimize data usage. ([#12296](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1226))

### Core Navigation
* Renamed the `RouteController.reroutesOpportunistically` property to `RouteController.reroutesProactively`, `RouteControllerOpportunisticReroutingInterval` global variable to `RouteControllerProactiveReroutingInterval`, and the `RouteControllerNotificationUserInfoKey.isOpportunisticKey` value to `RouteControllerNotificationUserInfoKey.isProactiveKey`. ([#1230](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1230))
* Added a `RouteStepProgress.currentIntersection` property that is set to the intersection the user has most recently passed along the route. ([#1127](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1127))

* The Constants that concern Route-Snapping logic have been re-named. The new names are: `RouteSnappingMinimumSpeed`, `RouteSnappingMaxManipulatedCourseAngle`, and `RouteSnappingMinimumHorizontalAccuracy`.

#### User interface
* `StepsViewController` 's convenience initializer (`StepsViewController.init(routeProgress:)`) is now public. ([#1167](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1167))
* Fixed an issue preventing the distance from appearing in the turn banner when the system language was set to Hebrew and the system region was set to Israel or any other region that uses the metric system. ([#1176](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1176))
* Various views and view controllers correctly mirror right-to-left in Hebrew. ([#1182](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1182))

#### Core Navigation
* `RoteController` now has a new property, `snappedLocation`. This property represents the raw location, snapped to the current route, if applicable. If not applicable, the value is `nil`.
* `RouteController`'s `MBRouteControllerProgressDidChange` notification now exposes the raw location in it's update, accessible by `MBRouteControllerRawLocationKey`

#### Voice guidance

* Fixed an issue that caused `RouteVoiceController` and `MabpboxVoiceController` to speak over one another. [#1213](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1213)

#### Other changes
* Fixed a crash while navigating that affected applications that do not use Mapbox-hosted styles or vector tiles. [#1183](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1183)
* The `DistanceFormatter.attributedString(for:)` method is now implemented. It returns an attributed string representation of the distance in which the `NSAttributedStringKey.quantity` attribute is applied to the numeric quantity. ([#1176](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1176))
* Fixed an issue in which turn lanes were displayed in the wrong order when the system language was set to Hebrew. ([#1175](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1175))

## v0.14.0 (February 22, 2018)

#### Breaking changes

* Removed the dependency on AWSPolly. Voice announcements are now coming directly from Mapbox and for free for all developers. Because of this, PollyVoiceController has been removed.  [#617](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/617)
* MapboxDirections.swift version 0.17.x is now required. [#1085](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1085)
* Removed the key `RouteControllerNotificationUserInfoKey.estimatedTimeUntilManeuverKey` from `.routeControllerProgressDidChange`. Please use `durationRemaining` instead which can be found on the `RouteProgress`. [#1126](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1126/)
* Renamed notification names associated with `RouteController` in Objective-C code. [#1122](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1122)
* The user info keys of `RouteController`-related notifications have been renamed and are now members of the `RouteControllerNotificationUserInfoKey` struct in Swift and the `MBRouteControllerNotificationUserInfoKey` extensible enumeration in Objective-C. [#1122](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1122)

* Location updates sent via `.routeControllerProgressDidChange` are now always sent as long as the location is qualified. [#1126](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1126/)
* Exposes `setOverheadCameraView(from:along:for:)` which is useful for fitting the camera to an overhead view for the remaining route coordinates.
* Changed the heuristics needed for a the users location to unsnap from the route line. [#1110](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1122)
* Changes `routeController(:didDiscardLocation:)` to `routeController(:shouldDiscardLocation:)`. Now if implemented, developers can choose to keep a location when RouteController deems a location unqualified. [#1095](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1095/)

## User interface

* Added a `NavigationMapView.localizeLabels()` method that should be called within `MGLMapViewDelegate.mapView(_:didFinishLoading:)` for standalone `NavigationMapView`s to ensure that map labels are in the correct language. [#1111](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1122)
* The `/` delimiter is longer shown when a shield is shown on either side of the delimiter. This also removes the dependency SDWebImage. [#1046](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1046)
* Exposes constants used for styling the route line. [#1124](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1124/)
* Exposes `update(for:)` on `InstructionBannerView`. This is helpful for developers creating a custom user interface. [#1085](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1085/)

## Voice guidance

* Exposes `RouteVoiceController.speak(_:)` which would allow custom subclass of MapboxVoiceController to override this method and pass a modified SpokenInstruction to our superclass implementation.

## v0.13.1 (February 7, 2018)

### Core Navigation

* Fixes a bug where the `spokenInstructionIndex` was incremented beyond the number of instructions for a step. (#1080)
* Fixed a bug that crashed when navigating beyond the final waypoint. (#1087)
* Added `NavigationSettings.distanceUnit` to let a user override the default unit of measurement for the device’s region setting. (#1055)

### User interface

* Added support for spoken instructions in Danish. (#1041)
* Updated translations for Russian, Swedish, Spanish, Vietnamese, Hebrew, Ukrainian, and German. (#1064)
* Fixed a bug that prevented the user puck from laying flat when rotating the map. (#1090)
* Updated translations for Russian, Swedish, Spanish, Vietnamese, Hebrew, Ukrainian, and German. (#1064) (#1089)

## v0.13.0 (January 22, 2018)

### Packaging

* Upgraded to MapboxDirections.swift [v0.16.0](https://github.com/mapbox/MapboxDirections.swift/releases/tag/v0.16.0), which makes `ManeuverType`, `ManeuverDirection`, and `TransportType` non-optional. (#1040)
* Added Danish and Hebrew localizations. (#1031, #1043)

### User location

* Removed `RouteControllerDelegate.routeController(_:shouldIncrementLegWhenArrivingAtWaypoint:)` and `NavigationViewControllerDelegate.navigationViewController(_:shouldIncrementLegWhenArrivingAtWaypoint:)`. `RouteControllerDelegate.routeController(_:didArriveAt:)` and `NavigationViewControllerDelegate.navigationViewController(_:didArriveAt:)` now return a Boolean that determines whether the route controller automatically advances to the next leg of the route. (#1038)
* Fixed an issue where `NavigationViewControllerDelegate.navigationViewController(_:didArriveAt:)` was called twice at the end of the route. (#1038)
* Improved the reliability of user location tracking when several location updates arrive simultaneously. (#1021)

### User interface

* Removed the `WayNameView` class in favor of `WayNameLabel` and renamed the `LanesContainerView` class to `LanesView`. (#981 )
* Added a `NavigationMapView.tracksUserCourse` property for enabling course tracking mode when using the map view independently of `NavigationViewController`. (#1015)

## v0.12.2 (January 12, 2018)

Beginning with this release, we’ve compiled [a set of examples](https://docs.mapbox.com/ios/api/navigation/0.12.2/Examples.html) showing how to accomplish common tasks with this SDK. You can also check out the [navigation-ios-examples](https://github.com/mapbox/navigation-ios-examples) project and run the included application on your device.

### User interface

* Fixed a crash loading `NavigationViewController`. (#977)
* Fixed issues causing the user puck to animate at the wrong framerate while the device is unplugged. (#970)
* Fixed unexpected behavior that occurred if only one `Style` was specified when initializing `NavigationViewController`. (#990)

### Core Navigation

* If `RouteController` initially follows an alternative route, it now attempts to follow the most similar route after rerouting. (#995)
* Fixed an issue preventing the `RouteControllerDelegate.routeController(_:didArriveAt:)` method from being called if `navigationViewController(_:shouldIncrementLegWhenArrivingAtWaypoint:)` was unimplemented. (#984)
* Added a `VoiceControllerDelegate.voiceController(_:willSpeak:routeProgress:)` method for changing spoken instructions on an individual basis. (#988)

## v0.12.1 (January 6, 2018)

### User interface

* Fixed an issue where the “then” banner appeared at the wrong times. (#957)
* Fixed an issue where the user location view spun around at the end of a leg. (#966)

### Core Navigation

* The `RouteControllerDelegate.routeController(_:didArriveAt:)` method is now called when arriving at any waypoint, not just the last waypoint. (#972)
* Added a `RouteController.setEndOfRoute(_:comment:)` method for collecting feedback about the route before the user cancels it. (#965)

## v0.12.0 (December 21, 2017)

### Breaking changes 🚨

* If you install this SDK using Carthage, you must now include each of this SDK’s dependencies in your Run Script build phase: AWSCore.framework, AWSPolly.framework, Mapbox.framework, MapboxDirections.framework, MapboxMobileEvents.framework, Polyline.framework, SDWebImage.framework, Solar.framework, and Turf.framework. These dependencies are no longer embedded inside MapboxNavigation.framework. See [the Carthage documentation](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage#if-youre-building-for-ios-tvos-or-watchos) for details. (#930)
* This library no longer depends on [OSRM Text Instructions for Swift](https://github.com/Project-OSRM/osrm-text-instructions.swift/). If you have previously installed this SDK using Carthage, you may need to remove OSRMTextInstructions.framework from a Run Script build step. (#925)
* Notification names are now members of `Notification.Name`. (#943)

### User interface

* When the user approaches the final waypoint, a panel appears with options for sending feedback about the route. (#848)
* Fixed an issue preventing the “Then” banner from appearing. (#940)
* Fixed an issue that sometimes prevented the night style from being applied. (#904)
* The turn banner’s labels and route shield images are now derived from the Directions API response. (#767)
* Roundabout icons in the turn banner now go clockwise in regions that drive on the left. (#911)
* Fixed an issue that turned the estimated arrival time to black when traffic congestion data was unavailable. (#912)
* Added a Bulgarian localization. [Help us speak your language!](https://www.transifex.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/) (#954)
* Updated Dutch, Spanish, Swedish, and Vietnamese translations. (#944)

### Voice guidance

* Tapping the mute button immediately silences any current announcement. (#936)
* Improved announcements near roundabouts and rotaries when using `NavigationRouteOptions`. You can also set the `RouteOptions.includesExitRoundaboutManeuver` property manually to take advantage of this improvement. (#945)
* You can customize the AWS region used for Amazon Polly spoken instructions using the `PollyVoiceController(identityPoolId:regionType:)` initializer. (#914)
* Certain roads [tagged with pronunciations in OpenStreetMap](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:name:pronunciation) are pronounced correctly when Amazon Polly is unavailable. (#624)
* Refined the appearance of the spoken instruction map labels that are enabled via the `NavigationViewController.annotatesSpokenInstructions` property. (#907)

### User location

* When `SimulatedLocationManager` is active, the user can swipe on the “Simulating Navigation” banner to adjust the rate of travel. (#915)
* Fixed unnecessary rerouting that sometimes occurred if the user advanced to a subsequent step earlier than expected. (#910)
* If your application’s Info.plist file lacks a location usage description, `NavigationViewController` will immediately fail a `precondition`. (#947)

## v0.11.0 (November 29, 2017)

Beginning with this release, the navigation SDK and Core Navigation are written in Swift 4 (#663).

### Feedback

* Removed the audio feedback recording feature. You no longer need to add an `NSMicrophoneUsageDescription` to your Info.plist. (#870)
* The Report Feedback button no longer appears after rerouting if `NavigationViewController.showsReportFeedback` is disabled. (#890)

### User interface

* Added a `StepsViewController` class for displaying the route’s upcoming steps in a table view. (#869)
* The bottom bar is more compact in landscape orientation. (#863)
* Fixed an issue where the “then” banner appeared too soon. (#865)
* Maneuver arrows are no longer shown for arrival maneuvers. (#884)
* Fixed a crash that sometimes occurred after returning to the application from the background. (#888)

### Voice guidance

* A new `RouteVoiceController.voiceControllerDelegate` property lets an object conforming to the `VoiceControllerDelegate` protocol know when a spoken instruction fails or gets interrupted by another instruction. (#800, #864)

### User location

* Fixed an issue that sometimes prevented `NavigationViewControllerDelegate.navigationViewController(_:didArriveAt:)` from getting called. (#883)
* Fixed an issue where the user location indicator floated around when starting a new leg. (#886)

## v0.10.1 (November 16, 2017)

### Packaging

* Reverts a change that used AWS's repo for the Polly dependency. This will help with build times when using Carthage. #859
* Updates Polly dependency to v2.6.5 #859

* Fixes a bug on `InstructionsBannerView` and `StepInstructionsView` that prevented them from being styleable. #852
* Fixes a few minor styleable elements on `DayStyle` and `NightStyle`. #858

### Map

* `MGLMapView init(frame:styleURL:)` is exposed again on `NavigationMapView`. #850

### User location tracking

* The refresh rate of the user puck remains throttled if the upcoming step is straight. #845

### Feedback

* The `Report Feedback` button after rerouting is only displayed for 5 seconds. #853

## v0.10.0 (November 13, 2017)

### Packaging

* Xcode 9 is required for building the navigation SDK or Core Navigation. (#786)
* Added German and Dutch localizations. [Help us speak your language!](https://www.transifex.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/dashboard/) (#778)
* To build and run the provided sample applications, you now have the option to create a plain text file named .mapbox containing a Mapbox access token and place it in your home folder. The SDK will read this file and automatically populate the `MGLMapboxAccessToken` of the `Info.plist` at build-time. (#817)

### Instruction banner

* Improved `NavigationViewController`’s layout on iPhone X. (#786, #816)
* Refined the turn banner’s appearance. (#745, #788)
* Added a reusable `InstructionBannerView` class that represents the turn banner. (#745)
* Route shields are displayed inline with road or place names in `InstructionBannerView`. (#745)
* When another step follows soon after the upcoming step, that subsequent step appears in a smaller banner beneath the main turn banner. (#819)

### Map

* The map zooms in and out dynamically to show more of the road ahead. (#769, #781)
* Replaced `NavigationMapView.showRoute(_:)` with `NavigationMapView.showRoutes(_:legIndex:)`, which can show alternative routes on the map. (#789)
* Added a `NavigationMapViewDelegate.navigationMapView(_:didSelect:)` method to respond to route selection on the map. (#789, #806)
* Added a `NavigationMapViewDelegate.navigationMapView(_:didSelect:)` method to respond to waypoint selection on the map. (#806)
* Fixed a bug preventing legs beyond the third waypoint from appearing. (#807)
* Decreased the map’s animation frame rate for improved battery life. (#760)

### Voice guidance

* Spoken instructions are determined by Directions API responses. (#614)
* When Polly is enabled, audio for spoken instructions is fetched over the network ahead of time, reducing latency. (#724, #768)
* The `NavigationViewController.annotatesSpokenInstructions` property, disabled by default, makes it easier to see where instructions will be read aloud along the route for debugging purposes. (#727, #826)
* Fixed an issue preventing `PollyVoiceController` from ducking background audio while the device is muted using the physical switch. (#805)

### User location tracking

* Fixed an issue causing poor user location tracking on iPhone X. (#833)
* The user location indicator is more stable while snapped to the route line. (#754)
* Renamed `RouteController.checkForFasterRouteInBackground` to `RouteController.reroutesOpportunistically`. (#826)
* Added a `RouteControllerOpportunisticReroutingInterval` constant for configuring the interval between opportunistic rerouting attempts. (#826)

### Feedback

* The `NavigationViewController.recordsAudioFeedback` property, disabled by default, allows the user to dictate feedback by long-pressing on a feedback item. This option requires the `NSMicrophoneUsageDescription` Info.plist option. (#719, #826)
* Options in the feedback interface are easier to discern from each other. (#761)
* Fixed an issue where the feedback interface appeared automatically after rerouting. (#749)
* Rearranged the feedback options. (#770, #779)

## v0.9.0 (October 17, 2017)

* `NavigationMapView` uses a custom course tracking mode created from the ground up. The view representing the user’s location (the “user puck”) is larger and easier to see at a glance, and it continues to point in the user’s direction of travel even in Overview mode. To customize the user puck, use the `NavigationMapView.userCourseView` property. (#402)
* Fixed an issue causing the user puck to slide downward from the center of the screen when beginning a new route. (#402)
* You can customize the user puck’s location on screen by implementing the `NavigationViewControllerDelegate.navigationViewController(_:mapViewUserAnchorPoint:)` method. (#402)
* Improved user course snapping while not moving. (#718)
* Throttled the map’s frame rate while the device is unplugged. (#709)

## v0.8.1 (September 28, 2017)

* Fixed a build error that occurred if MapboxNavigation was installed via CocoaPods. (#632)
* The turn banner shows more of the upcoming road name before truncating. (#657)
* When entering a roundabout, the icon in the turn banner indicates the correct direction of travel. (#640)
* When beginning a new route, the SDK announces the initial road and direction of travel. (#654)
* Fixed an issue causing the user’s location to be snapped to the wrong part of the route near a U-turn. (#642)
* Core Navigation detects when the user performs a U-turn earlier than anticipated and promptly calculates a new route. (#646)
* If Amazon Polly is configured but unreachable, the SDK switches to AVSpeechSynthesizer sooner, before the instruction becomes outdated. (#652)
* When instructions are announced by Amazon Polly, [dynamic range compression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_range_compression) is used to make the audio easier to hear over the din of a moving vehicle. (#635, #662)

## v0.8.0 (September 19, 2017)

* The turn banner abbreviates road names when using the Catalan, Lithuanian, Spanish, Swedish, or Vietnamese localization. (#254, #376)

### Voice guidance

* To use Amazon Polly for voice guidance, set the `NavigationViewController.voiceController` property. (#313)
* Fixed an issue that disabled Polly-powered voice guidance when the application went to the background. A message is printed to the console if the `audio` background mode is missing from the application’s Info.plist file. (#356)
* Fixed a crash that could occur when the device is muted and an instruction would normally be read aloud. (#275)
* By default, a short audio cue now plays when the user diverges from the route, requiring a new route to be fetched. (#269)
* Renamed `RouteStepFormatter.string(for:markUpWithSSML:)` to `RouteStepFormatter.string(for:legIndex:numberOfLegs:markUpWithSSML:)`. (#348)

### Navigation

* Fixed a crash after a simulated route causes the SDK to fetch a new route. (#344)
* Fixed an issue that stopped location updates after the application returned to the foreground from the background. (#343)
* Fixed excessive calls to `NavigationViewControllerDelegate.navigationViewController(_:didArriveAt:)`. (#347)
* Fixed crashes that occurred during turn-by-turn navigation. (#271, #336)
* Fixed a memory leak that occurs when `NavigationViewController.navigationDelegate` is set. (#316)

### Core Navigation

* RouteController now requests Always Location Services permissions if `NSLocationAlwaysAndWhenInUseUsageDescription` is set in Info.plist. (#342)
* RouteController now continues to track the user’s location after arriving at the destination. (#333)
* Fixed an issue causing RouteController to alternate rapidly between steps. (#258)
* The SimulatedLocationManager class now bridges to Objective-C. (#314)
* The DistanceFormatter class has been moved to Core Navigation. (#309)

## v0.4.0 (June 1, 2017)

### Packaging

* Documentation is now available in Quick Help and code completion for most classes and methods. (#250)
* Added Catalan, Swedish, and Vietnamese localizations. (#203)

### User interface

* A new class, `Style`, makes it easy to customize the SDK’s appearance and vary it by size class. (#162)
* Fixed an issue causing the road name in the turn banner to be truncated. The road name may be abbreviated to fit the allotted space. (#215)
* Enlarged the distance in the turn banner. (#217)
* A button at the top-left corner of the map view displays a live overview of the route. (#106)
* A small label at the bottom of the map view displays the name of the street along which the user is currently traveling. (#155)
* `NavigationViewController` automatically adopts the tint color of the view controller that presents it. (#176)
* The user can no longer swipe the turn banner left of the current step to “preview” already completed steps. (#223)
* The U-turn icon in the turn banner is no longer flipped horizontally in countries that drive on the right. (#243)
* Distances are now measured in imperial units when the user’s language is set to British English. (#246)

### Voice guidance

* Fixed an issue causing voice instructions to be delivered by an Australian English voice regardless of the user’s region. (#187, #245)
* Fixed an issue causing a “continue” instruction to be repeated multiple times along the step. (#238)
* A final voice instruction is no longer delivered when merging onto a highway. (#239)

### Core Navigation

* `RouteController` is now responsible for the basic aspects of rerouting, including fetching the new route. A new `RouteControllerDelegate` protocol (mirrored by `NavigationViewControllerDelegate`) has methods for preventing or reacting to a rerouting attempt. (#251)
* A notification is posted as soon as Core Navigation successfully receives a new route or fails to receive a new route. (#251)
* When rerouting, any remaining intermediate waypoints are preserved in the new route. (#251)
* Improved the timing and accuracy of rerouting attempts. (#202, #228)
* Fixed an issue preventing the route progress (and thus the progress bar) from completing as the user arrives at the destination. (#157)
* Fixed an issue that affected Core Navigation’s accuracy near maneuvers. (#185)
* A simulated route performs maneuvers more realistically than before. (#226)
* Fixed an issue preventing a simulated route from reaching the end of the route. (#244)
* Resolved some compiler warnings related to the location manager. (#190)

## v0.3.0 (April 25, 2017)

* Renamed `RouteViewController` to `NavigationViewController`. (#133)
* Replaced the `NavigationUI.routeViewController(for:)` method with the `NavigationViewController(for:)` initializer. (#133)
* Fixed compatibility with MapboxDirections.swift v0.9.0. This library now depends on MapboxDirections.swift v0.9.x. (#139)
* Fixed an issue causing the SDK to ignore certain routing options when rerouting the user. (#139)
* Added a `NavigationViewController.simulatesLocationUpdates` property that causes the SDK to simulate location updates along a route. (#111)
* Added a `NavigationViewControllerDelegate.navigationViewController(_:didArriveAt:)` method that gets called when user arrives at the destination. (#158)
* Added methods to NavigationViewControllerDelegate to customize the appearance and shape of the route line. (#135)
* Fixed an issue preventing the volume setting from working when using the built-in system speech synthesizer. (#160)
* Added support for Russian and Spanish voices when using Amazon Polly for voice alerts. (#153)

## v0.2.1 (April 15, 2017)

* This library now requires MapboxDirections.swift v0.8.x as opposed to v0.9.0, which is incompatible. ([#150](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/150))

## v0.2.0 (April 14, 2017)

* Renamed MapboxNavigation and MapboxNavigationUI to MapboxCoreNavigation and MapboxNavigation, respectively. MapboxNavigation provides the complete turn-by-turn navigation experience, including UI and voice announcements, while MapboxCoreNavigation provides the raw utilities for building your own UI. ([#129](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/129))
* Exposed methods on NavigationMapView that you can override to customize the route line’s appearance on the map. ([#116](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/116))
* Removed an unused dependency on MapboxGeocoder.swift. ([#112](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/112))
* Fixed memory leaks. ([#120](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/120))

## v0.1.0 (March 30, 2017)

* Adds MapboxNavigationUI for a drop in navigation experience
* Allows for Integration with [AWS Polly](https://aws.amazon.com/polly/) for improved voice announcements
* Adds optional user snapping to route line. This option also snaps the users course
* Fixes an issue where announcements with`Continue`would not announce the way names correctly
* Updates to Swift v3.1
* Fixed an issue where the route line was not inserted below labels after re-routing.

## v0.0.4 (January 24, 2017)

- Fixed an issue where a `finalHeading` just below `360` and a user heading just above `0`, would not be less than `RouteControllerMaximumAllowedDegreeOffsetForTurnCompletion` ([#25](https://github.com/mapbox/MapboxNavigation.swift/pull/25))
- Better specified the swift version ([#26](https://github.com/mapbox/MapboxNavigation.swift/pull/26))

## v0.0.3 (January 19, 2017)

- Fixes CocoaPod installation error

## v0.0.2 (January 19, 2017)
