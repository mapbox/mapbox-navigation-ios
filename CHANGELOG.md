# Changes to the Mapbox Navigation SDK for iOS

## v0.18.1 (June 19, 2018)

### Packaging

* Increased the minimum deployment target of Core Navigation to iOS 9. ([#1494](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1494))

### User interface

* Added `NavigationMapView.recenterMap()` for recentering the map if a user gesture causes it to stop following the user. ([#1471](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1471))
* Deprecated `NavigationViewController.usesNightStyleInsideTunnels`. Style switching is enabled as a side effect of `TunnelIntersectionManager.tunnelSimulationEnabled`, which is set to `true` by default. ([#1489]
* Fixed an issue where the user location view slid around after the user pressed the Overview button. [#1506](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1506)

### Core Navigation

* Moved `RouteController.tunnelSimulationEnabled` to `TunnelIntersectionManager.tunnelSimulationEnabled`. ([#1489](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1489))
(https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1489))
* Added `RouteControllerDelegate.routeControllerWillDisableBatteryMonitoring(_:)` which allows developers control whether battery monitoring is disabled when `RouteController.deinit()` is called. [#1476](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1476)
* Fixed an issue where setting `NavigationLocationManager.desiredAccuracy` had no effect. [#1481](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1481)

## v0.18.0 (June 5, 2018)

### User interface

* Added support for generic route shields. Image-backed route shields also now display as generic (instead of plain text) while the SDK loads the image. [#1190](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/issues/1190), [#1417](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1417)
* Fixed an issue when going into overhead mode with a short route. [#1456](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1456/)
* Adds support for Xcode 10 Beta 1. [#1499](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1499), [#1478](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1478)

### Core Navigation

* `TunnelIntersectionManagerDelegate` methods no longer take a completion handler argument. ([#1414](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1414))
* Added the ability to render more than 1 alternate route. [#1372](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1372/)
* `NavigationMapViewDelegate.navigationMapView(_:shapeFor:)` Now expects an array of `Route`. The first route will be rendered as the main route, all subsequent routes will be rendered as alternate routes.
* Animating the user through tunnels and automatically switching the map style when entering a tunnel is now on by default. [#1449](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1449)
* Adds `RouteControllerDelegate.routeController(_:shouldPreventReroutesWhenArrivingAt:waypoint:)` which is called each time a driver arrives at a waypoint. By default, this method returns true and prevents rerouting upon arriving. Progress updates still occur. [#1454](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1454/)

## v0.17.0 (May 14, 2018)

### Packaging

* Upgraded to the [Mapbox Maps SDK for iOS v4.0.0](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/releases/tag/ios-v4.0.0). If you have customized the route map’s appearance, you may need to migrate your code to use expressions instead of style functions. ([#1076](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1076))
* Added a Korean localization. ([#1346](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1346))

### User interface

* Exit indications are now drawn accurately with a correct exit heading. ([#1288](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1288))
* Added the `NavigationViewControllerDelegate.navigationViewController(_:roadNameAt:)` method for customizing the contents of the road name label that appears towards the bottom of the map view. ([#1309](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1309))
* If the SDK tries but fails to reroute the user, the “Rerouting…” status view no longer stays visible permanently. ([#1357](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1357))
* Completed waypoints now remain on the map but are slightly translucent. ([#1364](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1364))
* Fixed an issue preventing `NavigationViewController.navigationMapView(_:simplifiedShapeDescribing:)` (now `NavigationViewController.navigationMapView(_:simplifiedShapeFor:)`) from being called. ([#1413](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1413))

### Spoken instructions

* Fixed an issue causing the wrong instructions to be spoken. ([#1396](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1396))

### User location

* The `RouteController.routeProgress` property is now available in Objective-C. ([#1323](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1323))
* Added a `RouteController.tunnelSimulationEnabled` option that keeps the user location indicator moving steadily while the user travels through a tunnel and GPS reception is unreliable. ([#1218](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1218))

### Other changes

* `DistanceFormatter`, `ReplayLocationManager`, `SimulatedLocationManager`, `LanesView`, and `ManueverView` are now subclassable. ([#1345](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1345]))
* Renamed many `NavigationViewController` and `NavigationMapViewDelegate` methods ([#1364](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1364), [#1338](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1338), [#1318](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1318), [#1378](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1378), [#1413](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1413)):
    * `NavigationViewControllerDelegate.navigationViewControllerDidCancelNavigation(_:)` to `NavigationViewControllerDelegate.navigationViewControllerDidDismiss(_:byCanceling:)`
    * `-[MBNavigationViewControllerDelegate navigationViewController:didArriveAt:]` to `-[MBNavigationViewControllerDelegate navigationViewController:didArriveAtWaypoint:]` in Objective-C
    * `NavigationViewControllerDelegate.navigationMapView(_:routeStyleLayerWithIdentifier:source:)` to `NavigationViewControllerDelegate.navigationViewController(_:routeStyleLayerWithIdentifier:source:)`
    * `NavigationViewControllerDelegate.navigationMapView(_:routeCasingStyleLayerWithIdentifier:source:)` to `NavigationViewControllerDelegate.navigationViewController(_:routeCasingStyleLayerWithIdentifier:source:)`
    * `NavigationViewControllerDelegate.navigationMapView(_:shapeFor:)` to `NavigationViewControllerDelegate.navigationViewController(_:shapeFor:)`

    * `-[MBNavigationViewControllerDelegate navigationViewController:shouldDiscard:]` to `-[MBNavigationViewControllerDelegate navigationViewController:shouldDiscardLocation:]` in Objective-C
    * `-[MBNavigationViewControllerDelegate navigationViewController:roadNameAt:]` to `-[MBNavigationViewControllerDelegate navigationViewController:roadNameAtLocation:]`
    * `NavigationMapViewDelegate.navigationMapView(_:shapeDescribing:)` to `NavigationMapViewDelegate.navigationMapView(_:shapeFor:)`.
    * `NavigationMapViewDelegate.navigationMapView(_:simplifiedShapeDescribing:)` to `NavigationMapViewDelegate.navigationMapView(_:simplifiedShapeFor:)`.
    * `-[MBNavigationMapViewDelegate navigationMapView:shapeDescribingWaypoints:legIndex:]` to `-[MBNavigationMapViewDelegate navigationMapView:shapeForWaypoints:legIndex:]` in Objective-C
* `RouteController.recordFeedback(type:description:)` now returns a `UUID` instead of a string. Some `RouteController` methods have been renamed to accept `UUID`s as arguments instead of strings. ([#1413](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1413))
* Renamed `TunnelIntersectionManagerDelegate.tunnelIntersectionManager(_:willEnableAnimationAt:callback:)` to `TunnelIntersectionManagerDelegate.tunnelIntersectionManager(_:willEnableAnimationAt:completionHandler:)` and `TunnelIntersectionManagerDelegate.tunnelIntersectionManager(_:willDisableAnimationAt:callback:)` to `TunnelIntersectionManagerDelegate.tunnelIntersectionManager(_:willDisableAnimationAt:completionHandler:)`. ([#1413](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1413))

## v0.16.2 (April 13, 2018)

* Removes warnings when using Swift 4.1. [#1271](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1271)

### Spoken instructions

* Fixed an issue that would preemptively fallback to the default speech synthesizer. [#1284](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1284)

## v0.16.0 (March 26, 2018)

### User interface
* While the user travels through a tunnel, `NavigationMapView` temporarily applies a night style (a style whose `styleType` property is set to `StyleType.night`). ([#1127](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1127))
* The user can reveal the list of upcoming steps by swiping downward from the top banner. ([#1150](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1150))
* Renamed `StyleType.dayStyle` and `StyleType.nightStyle` to `StyleType.day` and `StyleType.night`, respectively. ([#1250](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1250))
* Fixed an issue causing the overview map to insist on centering the route upon each location update. ([#1223](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1223))
* Improved the contrast of `TimeRemainingLabel.trafficSevereColor` against `BottomBannerView.backgroundColor` in `NightStyle`. ([#1228](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1228))
* Fixed an issue where a slash appeared between two shields in the top banner. ([#1169](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1169))
* Fixed an issue where using `NavigationMapViewControllerDelegate.navigationMapView(_:imageFor:)` would not override the destination annotation. ([#1256](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1256))
* Adds a handle at the bottom of the banner to reveals additional instructions. ([#1253](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1253))

### Spoken instructions
* Audio data for spoken instructions is cached in device storage to minimize data usage. ([#12296](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1226))

### Core Navigation
* Renamed the `RouteController.reroutesOpportunistically` property to `RouteController.reroutesProactively`, `RouteControllerOpportunisticReroutingInterval` global variable to `RouteControllerProactiveReroutingInterval`, and the `RouteControllerNotificationUserInfoKey.isOpportunisticKey` value to `RouteControllerNotificationUserInfoKey.isProactiveKey`. ([#1230](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1230))
* Added a `RouteStepProgress.currentIntersection` property that is set to the intersection the user has most recently passed along the route. ([#1127](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1127))
* Fixed an issue where the `RouteStepProgress.upcomingIntersection` property was always set to the current step’s first intersection. ([#1127](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1127))
* Added support for using the Mapbox Map Matching API. [#1177](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1177)

### Other changes
* Added Arabic and European Portuguese localizations. ([#1252](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1251))

## v0.15.0 (March 13, 2018)

#### Breaking changes
* `NavigationMapViewDelegate` and `RouteMapViewControllerDelegate`: `navigationMapView(_:didTap:)` is now `navigationMapView(_:didSelect:)` [#1063](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1063)
* The Constants that concern Route-Snapping logic have been re-named. The new names are: `RouteSnappingMinimumSpeed`, `RouteSnappingMaxManipulatedCourseAngle`, and `RouteSnappingMinimumHorizontalAccuracy`.

#### User interface
* `StepsViewController` 's convienence initalizer (`StepsViewController.init(routeProgress:)`) is now public. ([#1167](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1167))
* Fixed an issue preventing the distance from appearing in the turn banner when the system language was set to Hebrew and the system region was set to Israel or any other region that uses the metric system. ([#1176](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1176))
* Various views and view controllers correctly mirror right-to-left in Hebrew. ([#1182](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1182))

#### Core Navigation
* `RoteController` now has a new property, `snappedLocation`. This property represents the raw location, snapped to the current route, if applicable. If not applicable, the value is `nil`.
* `RouteController`'s `MBRouteControllerProgressDidChange` notification now exposes the raw location in it's update, accessible by `MBRouteControllerRawLocationKey`

#### Voice guidance

* Fixed an issue that caused `RouteVoiceController` and `MabpboxVoiceController` to speak over one another. [#1213](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1213)

#### Other changes
* Fixed a crash while navigating that affected applications that do not use Mapbox-hosted styles or vector tiles. [#1183](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1183)
* The `DistanceFormatter.attributedString(for:)` method is now implemented. It returns an attributed string representation of the distance in which the `NSAttributedStringKey.quantity` attribute is applied to the numeric quantity. ([#1176](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1176))
* Fixed an issue in which turn lanes were displayed in the wrong order when the system language was set to Hebrew. ([#1175](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1175))

## v0.14.0 (February 22, 2018)

#### Breaking changes

* Removed the dependency on AWSPolly. Voice announcements are now coming directly from Mapbox and for free for all developers. Because of this, PollyVoiceController has been removed.  [#617](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/617)
* MapboxDirections.swift version 0.17.x is now required. [#1085](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1085)
* Removed the key `RouteControllerNotificationUserInfoKey.estimatedTimeUntilManeuverKey` from `.routeControllerProgressDidChange`. Please use `durationRemaining` instead which can be found on the `RouteProgress`. [#1126](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1126/)
* Renamed notification names associated with `RouteController` in Objective-C code. [#1122](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1122)
* The user info keys of `RouteController`-related notifications have been renamed and are now members of the `RouteControllerNotificationUserInfoKey` struct in Swift and the `MBRouteControllerNotificationUserInfoKey` extensible enumeration in Objective-C. [#1122](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1122)

## Core Navigation

* Location updates sent via `.routeControllerProgressDidChange` are now always sent as long as the location is qualified. [#1126](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1126/)
* Exposes `setOverheadCameraView(from:along:for:)` which is useful for fitting the camera to an overhead view for the remaining route coordinates.
* Changed the heuristics needed for a the users location to unsnap from the route line. [#1110](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1122)
* Changes `routeController(:didDiscardLocation:)` to `routeController(:shouldDiscardLocation:)`. Now if implemented, developers can choose to keep a location when RouteController deems a location unqualified. [#1095](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1095/)

## User interface

* Added a `NavigationMapView.localizeLabels()` method that should be called within `MGLMapViewDelegate.mapView(_:didFinishLoading:)` for standalone `NavigationMapView`s to ensure that map labels are in the correct language. [#1111](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1122)
* The `/` delimiter is longer shown when a shield is shown on either side of the delimiter. This also removes the dependency SDWebImage. [#1046](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1046)
* Exposes constants used for styling the route line. [#1124](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1124/)
* Exposes `update(for:)` on `InstructionBannerView`. This is helpful for developers creating a custom user interface. [#1085](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/1085/)

## Voice guidance

* Exposes `RouteVoiceController.speak(_:)` which would allow custom subclass of MapboxVoiceController to override this method and pass a modified SpokenInstruction to our superclass implementation.


## v0.13.1 (February 7, 2018)

### Core Navigation

* Fixes a bug where the `spokenInstructionIndex` was incremented beyond the number of instructions for a step. (#1080)
* Fixed a bug that crashed when navigating beyond the final waypoint. (#1087)
* Added `NavigationSettings.distanceUnit` to let a user override the default unit of measurement for the device’s region setting. (#1055)

### User interface

* Added support for spoken instructions in Danish. (#1041)
* Updated translations for Russian, Swedish, Spanish, Vietnamese, Hebrew, Ukrainian, and German. (#1064)
* Fixed a bug that prevented the user puck from laying flat when rotating the map. (#1090)
* Updated translations for Russian, Swedish, Spanish, Vietnamese, Hebrew, Ukrainian, and German. (#1064) (#1089)

## v0.13.0 (January 22, 2018)

### Packaging

* Upgraded to MapboxDirections.swift [v0.16.0](https://github.com/mapbox/MapboxDirections.swift/releases/tag/v0.16.0), which makes `ManeuverType`, `ManeuverDirection`, and `TransportType` non-optional. (#1040)
* Added Danish and Hebrew localizations. (#1031, #1043)

### User location

* Removed `RouteControllerDelegate.routeController(_:shouldIncrementLegWhenArrivingAtWaypoint:)` and `NavigationViewControllerDelegate.navigationViewController(_:shouldIncrementLegWhenArrivingAtWaypoint:)`. `RouteControllerDelegate.routeController(_:didArriveAt:)` and `NavigationViewControllerDelegate.navigationViewController(_:didArriveAt:)` now return a Boolean that determines whether the route controller automatically advances to the next leg of the route. (#1038)
* Fixed an issue where `NavigationViewControllerDelegate.navigationViewController(_:didArriveAt:)` was called twice at the end of the route. (#1038)
* Improved the reliability of user location tracking when several location updates arrive simultaneously. (#1021)

### User interface

* Removed the `WayNameView` class in favor of `WayNameLabel` and renamed the `LanesContainerView` class to `LanesView`. (#981 )
* Added a `NavigationMapView.tracksUserCourse` property for enabling course tracking mode when using the map view independently of `NavigationViewController`. (#1015)

## v0.12.2 (January 12, 2018)

Beginning with this release, we’ve compiled [a set of examples](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-navigation-ios/navigation/0.12.2/Examples.html) showing how to accomplish common tasks with this SDK. You can also check out the [navigation-ios-examples](https://github.com/mapbox/navigation-ios-examples) project and run the included application on your device.

### User interface

* Fixed a crash loading `NavigationViewController`. (#977)
* Fixed issues causing the user puck to animate at the wrong framerate while the device is unplugged. (#970)
* Fixed unexpected behavior that occurred if only one `Style` was specified when initializing `NavigationViewController`. (#990)

### Core Navigation

* If `RouteController` initially follows an alternative route, it now attempts to follow the most similar route after rerouting. (#995)
* Fixed an issue preventing the `RouteControllerDelegate.routeController(_:didArriveAt:)` method from being called if `navigationViewController(_:shouldIncrementLegWhenArrivingAtWaypoint:)` was unimplemented. (#984)
* Added a `VoiceControllerDelegate.voiceController(_:willSpeak:routeProgress:)` method for changing spoken instructions on an individual basis. (#988)

## v0.12.1 (January 6, 2018)

### User interface

* Fixed an issue where the “then” banner appeared at the wrong times. (#957)
* Fixed an issue where the user location view spun around at the end of a leg. (#966)

### Core Navigation

* Fixed an issue that triggered unnecessary reroutes. (#959)
* The `RouteControllerDelegate.routeController(_:didArriveAt:)` method is now called when arriving at any waypoint, not just the last waypoint. (#972)
* Added a `RouteController.setEndOfRoute(_:comment:)` method for collecting feedback about the route before the user cancels it. (#965)

## v0.12.0 (December 21, 2017)

### Breaking changes 🚨

* If you install this SDK using Carthage, you must now include each of this SDK’s dependencies in your Run Script build phase: AWSCore.framework, AWSPolly.framework, Mapbox.framework, MapboxDirections.framework, MapboxMobileEvents.framework, Polyline.framework, SDWebImage.framework, Solar.framework, and Turf.framework. These dependencies are no longer embedded inside MapboxNavigation.framework. See [the Carthage documentation](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage#if-youre-building-for-ios-tvos-or-watchos) for details. (#930)
* This library no longer depends on [OSRM Text Instructions for Swift](https://github.com/Project-OSRM/osrm-text-instructions.swift/). If you have previously installed this SDK using Carthage, you may need to remove OSRMTextInstructions.framework from a Run Script build step. (#925)
* Notification names are now members of `Notification.Name`. (#943)

### User interface

* When the user approaches the final waypoint, a panel appears with options for sending feedback about the route. (#848)
* Fixed an issue preventing the “Then” banner from appearing. (#940)
* Fixed an issue that sometimes prevented the night style from being applied. (#904)
* The turn banner’s labels and route shield images are now derived from the Directions API response. (#767)
* Roundabout icons in the turn banner now go clockwise in regions that drive on the left. (#911)
* Fixed an issue that turned the estimated arrival time to black when traffic congestion data was unavailable. (#912)
* Added a Bulgarian localization. [Help us speak your language!](https://www.transifex.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/) (#954)
* Updated Dutch, Spanish, Swedish, and Vietnamese translations. (#944)

### Voice guidance

* Tapping the mute button immediately silences any current announcement. (#936)
* Improved announcements near roundabouts and rotaries when using `NavigationRouteOptions`. You can also set the `RouteOptions.includesExitRoundaboutManeuver` property manually to take advantage of this improvement. (#945)
* You can customize the AWS region used for Amazon Polly spoken instructions using the `PollyVoiceController(identityPoolId:regionType:)` initializer. (#914)
* Certain roads [tagged with pronunciations in OpenStreetMap](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:name:pronunciation) are pronounced correctly when Amazon Polly is unavailable. (#624)
* Refined the appearance of the spoken instruction map labels that are enabled via the `NavigationViewController.annotatesSpokenInstructions` property. (#907)

### User location

* When `SimulatedLocationManager` is active, the user can swipe on the “Simulating Navigation” banner to adjust the rate of travel. (#915)
* Fixed unnecessary rerouting that sometimes occurred if the user advanced to a subsequent step earlier than expected. (#910)
* If your application’s Info.plist file lacks a location usage description, `NavigationViewController` will immediately fail a `precondition`. (#947)

## v0.11.0 (November 29, 2017)

Beginning with this release, the navigation SDK and Core Navigation are written in Swift 4 (#663).

### Feedback

* Removed the audio feedback recording feature. You no longer need to add an `NSMicrophoneUsageDescription` to your Info.plist. (#870)
* The Report Feedback button no longer appears after rerouting if `NavigationViewController.showsReportFeedback` is disabled. (#890)

### User interface

* Added a `StepsViewController` class for displaying the route’s upcoming steps in a table view. (#869)
* The bottom bar is more compact in landscape orientation. (#863)
* Fixed an issue where the “then” banner appeared too soon. (#865)
* Maneuver arrows are no longer shown for arrival maneuvers. (#884)

### Voice guidance

* A new `RouteVoiceController.voiceControllerDelegate` property lets an object conforming to the `VoiceControllerDelegate` protocol know when a spoken instruction fails or gets interrupted by another instruction. (#800, #864)

### User location

* Fixed an issue that sometimes prevented `NavigationViewControllerDelegate.navigationViewController(_:didArriveAt:)` from getting called. (#883)
* Fixed an issue where the user location indicator floated around when starting a new leg. (#886)

## v0.10.1 (November 16, 2017)

### Packaging

* Reverts a change that used AWS's repo for the Polly dependency. This will help with build times when using Carthage. #859
* Updates Polly dependency to v2.6.5 #859

### Views

* Aligns the instruction banner and the next banner better. #860
* Fixes a bug on `InstructionsBannerView` and `StepInstructionsView` that prevented them from being styleable. #852
* Fixes a few minor styleable elements on `DayStyle` and `NightStyle`. #858

### Map

* `MGLMapView init(frame:styleURL:)` is exposed again on `NavigationMapView`. #850

### User location tracking

* The refresh rate of the user puck remains throttled if the upcoming step is straight. #845

### Feedback

* The `Report Feedback` button after rerouting is only displayed for 5 seconds. #853

## v0.10.0 (November 13, 2017)

### Packaging

* Xcode 9 is required for building the navigation SDK or Core Navigation. (#786)
* Added German and Dutch localizations. [Help us speak your language!](https://www.transifex.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/dashboard/) (#778)
* To build and run the provided sample applications, you now have the option to create a plain text file named .mapbox containing a Mapbox access token and place it in your home folder. The SDK will read this file and automatically populate the `MGLMapboxAccessToken` of the `Info.plist` at build-time. (#817)

### Instruction banner

* Improved `NavigationViewController`’s layout on iPhone X. (#786, #816)
* Refined the turn banner’s appearance. (#745, #788)
* Added a reusable `InstructionBannerView` class that represents the turn banner. (#745)
* Route shields are displayed inline with road or place names in `InstructionBannerView`. (#745)
* When another step follows soon after the upcoming step, that subsequent step appears in a smaller banner beneath the main turn banner. (#819)

### Map

* The map zooms in and out dynamically to show more of the road ahead. (#769, #781)
* Replaced `NavigationMapView.showRoute(_:)` with `NavigationMapView.showRoutes(_:legIndex:)`, which can show alternative routes on the map. (#789)
* Added a `NavigationMapViewDelegate.navigationMapView(_:didSelect:)` method to respond to route selection on the map. (#789, #806)
* Added a `NavigationMapViewDelegate.navigationMapView(_:didSelect:)` method to respond to waypoint selection on the map. (#806)
* Fixed a bug preventing legs beyond the third waypoint from appearing. (#807)
* Decreased the map’s animation frame rate for improved battery life. (#760)

### Voice guidance

* Spoken instructions are determined by Directions API responses. (#614)
* When Polly is enabled, audio for spoken instructions is fetched over the network ahead of time, reducing latency. (#724, #768)
* The `NavigationViewController.annotatesSpokenInstructions` property, disabled by default, makes it easier to see where instructions will be read aloud along the route for debugging purposes. (#727, #826)
* Fixed an issue preventing `PollyVoiceController` from ducking background audio while the device is muted using the physical switch. (#805)

### User location tracking

* Fixed an issue causing poor user location tracking on iPhone X. (#833)
* The user location indicator is more stable while snapped to the route line. (#754)
* Renamed `RouteController.checkForFasterRouteInBackground` to `RouteController.reroutesOpportunistically`. (#826)
* Added a `RouteControllerOpportunisticReroutingInterval` constant for configuring the interval between opportunistic rerouting attempts. (#826)

### Feedback

* The `NavigationViewController.recordsAudioFeedback` property, disabled by default, allows the user to dictate feedback by long-pressing on a feedback item. This option requires the `NSMicrophoneUsageDescription` Info.plist option. (#719, #826)
* Options in the feedback interface are easier to discern from each other. (#761)
* Fixed an issue where the feedback interface appeared automatically after rerouting. (#749)
* Rearranged the feedback options. (#770, #779)

## v0.9.0 (October 17, 2017)

* `NavigationMapView` uses a custom course tracking mode created from the ground up. The view representing the user’s location (the “user puck”) is larger and easier to see at a glance, and it continues to point in the user’s direction of travel even in Overview mode. To customize the user puck, use the `NavigationMapView.userCourseView` property. (#402)
* Fixed an issue causing the user puck to slide downward from the center of the screen when beginning a new route. (#402)
* You can customize the user puck’s location on screen by implementing the `NavigationViewControllerDelegate.navigationViewController(_:mapViewUserAnchorPoint:)` method. (#402)
* Improved user course snapping while not moving. (#718)
* Throttled the map’s frame rate while the device is unplugged. (#709)
* Fixed an issue causing the “Rerouting” banner to persist even after a new route is received. (#707)
* A local user notification is no longer posted when rerouting. (#708)

## v0.8.3 (October 9, 2017)

* Pins the dependency `Solar` to v2.0.0. This should fix some build issues. #693

## v0.8.1 (September 28, 2017)

* Fixed a build error that occurred if MapboxNavigation was installed via CocoaPods. (#632)
* The turn banner shows more of the upcoming road name before truncating. (#657)
* When entering a roundabout, the icon in the turn banner indicates the correct direction of travel. (#640)
* When beginning a new route, the SDK announces the initial road and direction of travel. (#654)
* Fixed an issue causing the user’s location to be snapped to the wrong part of the route near a U-turn. (#642)
* Core Navigation detects when the user performs a U-turn earlier than anticipated and promptly calculates a new route. (#646)
* If Amazon Polly is configured but unreachable, the SDK switches to AVSpeechSynthesizer sooner, before the instruction becomes outdated. (#652)
* When instructions are announced by Amazon Polly, [dynamic range compression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_range_compression) is used to make the audio easier to hear over the din of a moving vehicle. (#635, #662)

## v0.8.0 (September 19, 2017)

## v0.2.0 (April 14, 2017)

* Renamed MapboxNavigation and MapboxNavigationUI to MapboxCoreNavigation and MapboxNavigation, respectively. MapboxNavigation provides the complete turn-by-turn navigation experience, including UI and voice announcements, while MapboxCoreNavigation provides the raw utilities for building your own UI. ([#129](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/pull/129))
