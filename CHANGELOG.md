# Changes to the Mapbox Navigation SDK for iOS

## master

Beginning with this release, we‚Äôve compiled [a set of examples](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-navigation-ios/navigation/0.12.2/Examples.html) showing how to accomplish common tasks with this SDK. You can also check out the [navigation-ios-examples](https://github.com/mapbox/navigation-ios-examples) project and run the included application on your device.

### User interface

* Fixed a crash loading `NavigationViewController`. (#977)
* Fixed issues causing the user puck to animate at the wrong framerate while the device is unplugged. (#970)
* Fixed unexpected behavior that occurred if only one `Style` was specified when initializing `NavigationViewController`. (#990)

### Core Navigation

* If `RouteController` initially follows an alternative route, it now attempts to follow the most similar route after rerouting. (#995)
* Fixed an issue preventing the `RouteControllerDelegate.routeController(_:didArriveAt:)` method from being called if `navigationViewController(_:shouldIncrementLegWhenArrivingAtWaypoint:)` was unimplemented. (#984)
* Added a `VoiceControllerDelegate.voiceController(_:willSpeak:routeProgress:)` method for changing spoken instructions on an individual basis. (#988)

## v0.12.1 (January 6, 2018)

### User interface

* Fixed an issue where the ‚Äúthen‚Äù banner appeared at the wrong times. (#957)
* Fixed an issue where the user location view spun around at the end of a leg. (#966)

### Core Navigation

* Fixed an issue that triggered unnecessary reroutes. (#959)
* The `RouteControllerDelegate.routeController(_:didArriveAt:)` method is now called when arriving at any waypoint, not just the last waypoint. (#972)
* Added a `RouteController.setEndOfRoute(_:comment:)` method for collecting feedback about the route before the user cancels it. (#965)

## v0.12.0 (December 21, 2017)

### Breaking changes üö®

* If you install this SDK using Carthage, you must now include each of this SDK‚Äôs dependencies in your Run Script build phase: AWSCore.framework, AWSPolly.framework, Mapbox.framework, MapboxDirections.framework, MapboxMobileEvents.framework, Polyline.framework, SDWebImage.framework, Solar.framework, and Turf.framework. These dependencies are no longer embedded inside MapboxNavigation.framework. See [the Carthage documentation](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage#if-youre-building-for-ios-tvos-or-watchos) for details. (#930)
* This library no longer depends on [OSRM Text Instructions for Swift](https://github.com/Project-OSRM/osrm-text-instructions.swift/). If you have previously installed this SDK using Carthage, you may need to remove OSRMTextInstructions.framework from a Run Script build step. (#925)
* Notification names are now members of `Notification.Name`. (#943)

### User interface

* When the user approaches the final waypoint, a panel appears with options for sending feedback about the route. (#848)
* Fixed an issue preventing the ‚ÄúThen‚Äù banner from appearing. (#940)
* Fixed an issue that sometimes prevented the night style from being applied. (#904)
* The turn banner‚Äôs labels and route shield images are now derived from the Directions API response. (#767)
* Roundabout icons in the turn banner now go clockwise in regions that drive on the left. (#911)
* Fixed an issue that turned the estimated arrival time to black when traffic congestion data was unavailable. (#912)
* Added a Bulgarian localization. [Help us speak your language!](https://www.transifex.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/) (#954)
* Updated Dutch, Spanish, Swedish, and Vietnamese translations. (#944)

### Voice guidance

* Tapping the mute button immediately silences any current announcement. (#936)
* Improved announcements near roundabouts and rotaries when using `NavigationRouteOptions`. You can also set the `RouteOptions.includesExitRoundaboutManeuver` property manually to take advantage of this improvement. (#945)
* You can customize the AWS region used for Amazon Polly spoken instructions using the `PollyVoiceController(identityPoolId:regionType:)` initializer. (#914)
* Certain roads [tagged with pronunciations in OpenStreetMap](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:name:pronunciation) are pronounced correctly when Amazon Polly is unavailable. (#624)
* Refined the appearance of the spoken instruction map labels that are enabled via the `NavigationViewController.annotatesSpokenInstructions` property. (#907)

### User location

* When `SimulatedLocationManager` is active, the user can swipe on the ‚ÄúSimulating Navigation‚Äù banner to adjust the rate of travel. (#915)
* Fixed unnecessary rerouting that sometimes occurred if the user advanced to a subsequent step earlier than expected. (#910)
* If your application‚Äôs Info.plist file lacks a location usage description, `NavigationViewController` will immediately fail a `precondition`. (#947)

## v0.11.0 (November 29, 2017)

Beginning with this release, the navigation SDK and Core Navigation are written in Swift 4 (#663).

### Feedback

* Removed the audio feedback recording feature. You no longer need to add an `NSMicrophoneUsageDescription` to your Info.plist. (#870)
* The Report Feedback button no longer appears after rerouting if `NavigationViewController.showsReportFeedback` is disabled. (#890)

### User interface

* Added a `StepsViewController` class for displaying the route‚Äôs upcoming steps in a table view. (#869)
* The bottom bar is more compact in landscape orientation. (#863)
* Fixed an issue where the ‚Äúthen‚Äù banner appeared too soon. (#865)
* Maneuver arrows are no longer shown for arrival maneuvers. (#884)
* Fixed a crash that sometimes occurred after returning to the application from the background. (#888)

### Voice guidance

* A new `RouteVoiceController.voiceControllerDelegate` property lets an object conforming to the `VoiceControllerDelegate` protocol know when a spoken instruction fails or gets interrupted by another instruction. (#800, #864)

### User location

* Fixed an issue that sometimes prevented `NavigationViewControllerDelegate.navigationViewController(_:didArriveAt:)` from getting called. (#883)
* Fixed an issue where the user location indicator floated around when starting a new leg. (#886)

## v0.10.1 (November 16, 2017)

### Packaging

* Reverts a change that used AWS's repo for the Polly dependency. This will help with build times when using Carthage. #859 
* Updates Polly dependency to v2.6.5 #859

### Views

* Aligns the instruction banner and the next banner better. #860
* Fixes a bug on `InstructionsBannerView` and `StepInstructionsView` that prevented them from being styleable. #852
* Fixes a few minor styleable elements on `DayStyle` and `NightStyle`. #858

### Map

* `MGLMapView init(frame:styleURL:)` is exposed again on `NavigationMapView`. #850 

### User location tracking

* The refresh rate of the user puck remains throttled if the upcoming step is straight. #845

### Feedback

* The `Report Feedback` button after rerouting is only displayed for 5 seconds. #853

## v0.10.0 (November 13, 2017)

### Packaging

* Xcode 9 is required for building the navigation SDK or Core Navigation. (#786)
* Added German and Dutch localizations. [Help us speak your language!](https://www.transifex.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios/dashboard/) (#778)
* To build and run the provided sample applications, you now have the option to create a plain text file named .mapbox containing a Mapbox access token and place it in your home folder. The SDK will read this file and automatically populate the `MGLMapboxAccessToken` of the `Info.plist` at build-time. (#817)

### Instruction banner

* Improved `NavigationViewController`‚Äôs layout on iPhone X. (#786, #816)
* Refined the turn banner‚Äôs appearance. (#745, #788)
* Added a reusable `InstructionBannerView` class that represents the turn banner. (#745)
* Route shields are displayed inline with road or place names in `InstructionBannerView`. (#745)
* When another step follows soon after the upcoming step, that subsequent step appears in a smaller banner beneath the main turn banner. (#819)

### Map

* The map zooms in and out dynamically to show more of the road ahead. (#769, #781)
* Replaced `NavigationMapView.showRoute(_:)` with `NavigationMapView.showRoutes(_:legIndex:)`, which can show alternative routes on the map. (#789)
* Added a `NavigationMapViewDelegate.navigationMapView(_:didSelect:)` method to respond to route selection on the map. (#789, #806)
* Added a `NavigationMapViewDelegate.navigationMapView(_:didSelect:)` method to respond to waypoint selection on the map. (#806)
* Fixed a bug preventing legs beyond the third waypoint from appearing. (#807)
* Decreased the map‚Äôs animation frame rate for improved battery life. (#760)

### Voice guidance

* Spoken instructions are determined by Directions API responses. (#614)
* When Polly is enabled, audio for spoken instructions is fetched over the network ahead of time, reducing latency. (#724, #768)
* The `NavigationViewController.annotatesSpokenInstructions` property, disabled by default, makes it easier to see where instructions will be read aloud along the route for debugging purposes. (#727, #826)
* Fixed an issue preventing `PollyVoiceController` from ducking background audio while the device is muted using the physical switch. (#805)

### User location tracking

* Fixed an issue causing poor user location tracking on iPhone X. (#833)
* The user location indicator is more stable while snapped to the route line. (#754)
* Renamed `RouteController.checkForFasterRouteInBackground` to `RouteController.reroutesOpportunistically`. (#826)
* Added a `RouteControllerOpportunisticReroutingInterval` constant for configuring the interval between opportunistic rerouting attempts. (#826)

### Feedback

* The `NavigationViewController.recordsAudioFeedback` property, disabled by default, allows the user to dictate feedback by long-pressing on a feedback item. This option requires the `NSMicrophoneUsageDescription` Info.plist option. (#719, #826)
* Options in the feedback interface are easier to discern from each other. (#761)
* Fixed an issue where the feedback interface appeared automatically after rerouting. (#749)
* Rearranged the feedback options. (#770, #779)

## v0.9.0 (October 17, 2017)

* `NavigationMapView` uses a custom course tracking mode created from the ground up. The view representing the user‚Äôs location (the ‚Äúuser puck‚Äù) is larger and easier to see at a glance, and it continues to point in the user‚Äôs direction of travel even in Overview mode. To customize the user puck, use the `NavigationMapView.userCourseView` property. (#402)
* Fixed an issue causing the user puck to slide downward from the center of the screen when beginning a new route. (#402)
* You can customize the user puck‚Äôs location on screen by implementing the `NavigationViewControllerDelegate.navigationViewController(_:mapViewUserAnchorPoint:)` method. (#402)
* Improved user course snapping while not moving. (#718)
* Throttled the map‚Äôs frame rate while the device is unplugged. (#709)
* Fixed an issue causing the ‚ÄúRerouting‚Äù banner to persist even after a new route is received. (#707)
* A local user notification is no longer posted when rerouting. (#708)

## v0.8.3 (October 9, 2017)

* Pins the dependency `Solar` to v2.0.0. This should fix some build issues. #693
* Increases the width of the upcoming maneuver arrow. #671 
* Improved user location snapping. #679 
* Improves simulation mode by using more accurate speeds. #683 
* Adopted [Turf](https://github.com/mapbox/turf-swift). The `wrap(_:min:max:)` function has been removed; use Turf‚Äôs `CLLocationDirection.wrap(min:max:)` instead. #653
* Defaulted to `kCLLocationAccuracyBestForNavigation` for location accuracy. #670

## v0.8.2 (September 29, 2017)

* Fixed a bug which caused the upcoming maneuver label in night mode to have a white background (#667).
* Fixed a bug which caused audio announcements to be repeated over one another (#661,  #669).

## v0.8.1 (September 28, 2017)

* Fixed a build error that occurred if MapboxNavigation was installed via CocoaPods. (#632)
* The turn banner shows more of the upcoming road name before truncating. (#657)
* When entering a roundabout, the icon in the turn banner indicates the correct direction of travel. (#640)
* When beginning a new route, the SDK announces the initial road and direction of travel. (#654)
* Fixed an issue causing the user‚Äôs location to be snapped to the wrong part of the route near a U-turn. (#642)
* Core Navigation detects when the user performs a U-turn earlier than anticipated and promptly calculates a new route. (#646)
* If Amazon Polly is configured but unreachable, the SDK switches to AVSpeechSynthesizer sooner, before the instruction becomes outdated. (#652)
* When instructions are announced by Amazon Polly, [dynamic range compression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_range_compression) is used to make the audio easier to hear over the din of a moving vehicle. (#635, #662)

## v0.8.0 (September 19, 2017)

* Added Catalan, Swedish, and Vietnamese localizations. (#203)

### User interface

* A new class, `Style`, makes it easy to customize the SDK‚Äôs appearance and vary it by size class. (#162)
* Fixed an issue causing the road name in the turn banner to be truncated. The road name may be abbreviated to fit the allotted space. (#215)
* Enlarged the distance in the turn banner. (#217)
* A button at the top-left corner of the map view displays a live overview of the route. (#106)
