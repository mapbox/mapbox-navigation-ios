The Mapbox Navigation SDK is comprised of two modules:

* MapboxCoreNavigation - responsible for rerouting, snapping, progress updates etc.
* MapboxNavigation - responsible for everything UI related.

If the UI provided by MapboxNavigation is not something that can work for your project, it is possible to create a custom navigation experience built on top of MapboxCoreNavigation directly. Note, this is not ideal as it will be a lot of work for the developer. If there is something missing from the UI or not optimal, feel free to open a ticket instead of venturing down this path.

The installation process is very similar to installing the MapboxNavigation framework:

### Using Swift Package Manager

To install the MapboxCoreNavigation framework in an application using [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/):

1. Go to your [Mapbox account dashboard](https://account.mapbox.com/) and create an access token that has the `DOWNLOADS:READ` scope. **PLEASE NOTE: This is not the same as your production Mapbox API token. Make sure to keep it private and do not insert it into any Info.plist file.** Create a file named `.netrc` in your home directory if it doesn’t already exist, then add the following lines to the end of the file:
   ```
   machine api.mapbox.com
     login mapbox
     password PRIVATE_MAPBOX_API_TOKEN
   ```
   where _PRIVATE_MAPBOX_API_TOKEN_ is your Mapbox API token with the `DOWNLOADS:READ` scope.

1. In Xcode, go to File ‣ Swift Packages ‣ Add Package Dependency.

1. Enter `https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios.git` as the package repository and click Next.

1. Set Rules to Version, Up to Next Major, and enter `2.10.0` as the minimum version requirement. Click Next.

To install the MapboxCoreNavigation framework in another package rather than an application, run `swift package init` to create a Package.swift, then add the following dependency:

```swift
// Latest stable release
.package(name: "MapboxCoreNavigation", url: "https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios.git", from: "2.10.0")
// Latest prerelease
.package(name: "MapboxCoreNavigation", url: "https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios.git", .exact("2.10.0-rc.2"))
```

### Using CocoaPods

To install Mapbox Core Navigation using [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/):

1. Go to your [Mapbox account dashboard](https://account.mapbox.com/) and create an access token that has the `DOWNLOADS:READ` scope. **PLEASE NOTE: This is not the same as your production Mapbox API token. Make sure to keep it private and do not insert it into any Info.plist file.** Create a file named `.netrc` in your home directory if it doesn’t already exist, then add the following lines to the end of the file:
   ```
   machine api.mapbox.com
     login mapbox
     password PRIVATE_MAPBOX_API_TOKEN
   ```
   where _PRIVATE_MAPBOX_API_TOKEN_ is your Mapbox API token with the `DOWNLOADS:READ` scope.

1. Create a [Podfile](https://guides.cocoapods.org/syntax/podfile.html) with the following specification:
   ```ruby
   # Latest stable release
   pod 'MapboxCoreNavigation', '~> 2.10'
   # Latest prerelease
   pod 'MapboxCoreNavigation', :git => 'https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios.git', :tag => 'v2.10.0-rc.2'
   ```

1. Run `pod repo update && pod install` and open the resulting Xcode workspace.

### Using Carthage

MapboxNavigation no longer supports Carthage as of v2.0.0-alpha.1. However, if you are building a user interface from scratch, you can install just the MapboxCoreNavigation framework using Carthage.

To install Mapbox Navigation using [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage/) v0.38 or above:

1. Go to your [Mapbox account dashboard](https://account.mapbox.com/) and create an access token that has the `DOWNLOADS:READ` scope. **PLEASE NOTE: This is not the same as your production Mapbox API token. Make sure to keep it private and do not insert it into any Info.plist file.** Create a file named `.netrc` in your home directory if it doesn’t already exist, then add the following lines to the end of the file:
   ```
   machine api.mapbox.com
     login mapbox
     password PRIVATE_MAPBOX_API_TOKEN
   ```
   where _PRIVATE_MAPBOX_API_TOKEN_ is your Mapbox API token with the `DOWNLOADS:READ` scope.

1. _(Optional)_ Clear your Carthage caches:
   ```bash
   rm -rf ~/Library/Caches/carthage/ ~/Library/Caches/org.carthage.CarthageKit/binaries/{MapboxCommon-ios,MapboxNavigationNative}
   ```

1. Create a [Cartfile](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage/blob/master/Documentation/Artifacts.md#github-repositories) with the following dependency:
   ```cartfile
   # Latest stable release
   github "mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios" ~> 2.10
   # Latest prerelease
   github "mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios" "v2.10.0-rc.2"
   ```

1. Run `carthage bootstrap --platform iOS --use-xcframeworks --cache-builds --use-netrc`.

1. Follow the rest of [Carthage’s iOS integration instructions](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage#if-youre-building-for-ios-tvos-or-watchos). Your application target’s Embed Frameworks build phase should include `MapboxCoreNavigation.xcframework`, `MapboxNavigationNative.xcframework`, `MapboxCommon.xcframework`, and `MapboxAccounts.xcframework`.

### Using Xcode

To install the MapboxCoreNavigation framework using [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/) within Xcode:

1. Go to your [Mapbox account dashboard](https://account.mapbox.com/) and create an access token that has the `DOWNLOADS:READ` scope. **PLEASE NOTE: This is not the same as your production Mapbox API token. Make sure to keep it private and do not insert it into any Info.plist file.** Create a file named `.netrc` in your home directory if it doesn’t already exist, then add the following lines to the end of the file:
   ```
   machine api.mapbox.com
     login mapbox
     password PRIVATE_MAPBOX_API_TOKEN
   ```
   where _PRIVATE_MAPBOX_API_TOKEN_ is your Mapbox API token with the `DOWNLOADS:READ` scope.

1. In Xcode, go to File ‣ Swift Packages ‣ Add Package Dependency.

1. Enter `https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-ios.git` as the package repository and click Next.

1. Set Rules to Version, Up to Next Major, and enter `2.10.0` as the minimum version requirement. Click Next.
